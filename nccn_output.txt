LUNG CANCER PREVENTION AND SCREENING
• Lung cancer is a unique disease in that the major etiologic agent is an addictive product that is made and promoted by an industry. 
Approximately 85% to 90% of cases are caused by voluntary or involuntary (second-hand) cigarette smoking. Reduction of lung cancer 
mortality will require effective public health policies to prevent initiation of smoking, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight of 
tobacco products, and other tobacco control measures.
• The number of lung cancers in individuals who do not smoke is increasing worldwide. More research is necessary to identify relevant risk 
factors—such as environmental exposures (eg, indoor and outdoor air pollution, radon, asbestos), chronic lung diseases, and family history/
genetic predisposition—to augment lung cancer screening in the future.
• Persistent smoking is associated with second primary cancers, treatment complications, drug interactions, other tobacco-related medical 
conditions, diminished quality of life, and reduced survival. 
• Reports from the Surgeon General on both active smoking and second-hand smoke show that both cause lung cancer. The evidence shows a 
20% to 30% increase in the risk for lung cancer from second-hand smoke exposure associated with living with a person who smokes.  
Every person should be informed of the health consequences, addictive nature, and mortal threat posed by tobacco consumption and 
exposure to tobacco smoke, and effective legislative, executive, administrative, or other measures should be contemplated at the appropriate 
governmental level to protect all persons from exposure to tobacco smoke.
• Further complicating this problem, the delivery system of lung carcinogens also contains the highly addictive substance, nicotine. 
Reduction of lung cancer mortality will require widespread implementation of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 
Guidelines to identify, counsel, and treat people with nicotine habituation.
• People who smoke or who formerly smoked have significant risk for the development of lung cancer; chemoprevention agents are not yet 
established for these individuals. When possible, these people should be encouraged to enroll in chemoprevention trials.
• Lung cancer screening using low-dose CT (LDCT) is recommended in select individuals at high risk for lung cancer who smoke or formerly 
smoked (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening).
• See the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation.

For incidental findings of lung nodules suspicious for lung cancer in asymptomatic patients at high risk detected during lung cancer screening with LDCT, the steps are: Conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation including thoracic surgeons, radiologists, and pulmonologists to assess the likelihood of cancer and optimal diagnostic strategy, as well as provide smoking cessation counseling. Risk factors considered include patient factors like age, smoking history, previous cancer history, family history, occupational exposures, other lung diseases, exposure to infectious agents; and radiologic factors such as nodule size, shape, density, associated parenchymal abnormalities, and FDG avidity.
Based on this assessment, the pathway diverges for solid nodules and subsolid nodules, both leading to follow-up procedures (DIAG-2 and DIAG-3 respectively). For lung nodules detected in asymptomatic high-risk patients during lung cancer screening with LDCT, the chart directs to NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening. The flowchart emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary evaluation and notes that risk calculators, while useful, do not replace expert evaluation.

Based on the flowchart image, for incidental findings of solid nodule(s) on chest CT, the follow-up guidance can be summarized as:

For nodules ≤6 mm, no routine follow-up is recommended. For nodules 6-8 mm in low-risk patients, CT should be repeated at 6-12 months, then consider CT at 18-24 months if stable. For nodules >8 mm in low-risk patients, consider CT at 3 months, FDG-PET/CT, or biopsy. For nodules ≤6 mm in high-risk patients, CT at 12 months (optional) should be done, and if stable, no routine follow-up. For nodules 6-8 mm in high-risk patients, CT should be repeated at 6-12 months, and if stable, repeat CT at 18-24 months. For nodules >8 mm in high-risk patients, consider CT at 3 months, FDG-PET/CT, or biopsy.

=== PAGE 21 ===
The provided image outlines follow-up guidance for incidental findings of subsolid nodule(s) on chest CT scans. For solitary pure ground-glass nodules of <6 mm, no routine follow up is required whereas ≥6 mm, CT follow-up at 6-12 months is recommended to confirm no growth or development of a solid component, then CT every 2 years until 5 years. For solitary part-solid nodules <6 mm, no routine follow-up is advised, while those ≥6 mm require a CT at 3-6 months to assess for growth or change, followed by annual CT for 5 years if stable. If the solid component is ≥6 mm, FDG-PET/CT or biopsy should be considered. For multiple subsolid nodules <6 mm, a CT at 3-6 months is recommended, and if stable consider CT at 2 and 4 years. For multiple subsolid nodules with >6 a CT at 3-6 months is recommended with subsequent management based on the most suspicious nodule(s) if stable at that time point.

PRINCIPLES OF DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION
• The decision to pursue preoperative biopsy of a potential stage I lung cancer should be informed by the pre-test probability of malignancy. 
Factors that might be considered in pre-test probability assessment include risk factors, radiologic appearance (including comparison to 
prior chest imaging if available or FDG-PET/CT if performed), and current or prior residence in regions with prevalent endemic infectious 
lung disease (ie, fungal, mycobacterial), among other potential factors. 
Patients with very high pre-test probability of stage IA lung cancer do not require a biopsy before surgery. A biopsy adds time, costs, and 
procedural risk and may not be needed for treatment decisions. 
If a preoperative tissue diagnosis has not been obtained, then an intraoperative diagnosis (ie, wedge resection, needle biopsy) is necessary 
before lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy.
Situations in which a preoperative biopsy may be appropriate: 
 ◊A non-lung cancer diagnosis that can be diagnosed by minimally invasive biopsy is at least moderately likely (eg, granulomatous nodule 
due to endemic fungus). 
 ◊Suspected stage IB or higher lung cancer in patients who may be candidates for systemic therapy prior to surgery. 
 ◊An intraoperative diagnosis appears difficult or very risky. 
 ◊To establish the diagnosis prior to stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR)
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 23 ===
PRINCIPLES OF DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION
• A preoperative bronchoscopy may also be preferred for tissue diagnosis and/or mediastinal staging (endobronchial ultrasound [EBUS]).
• If a bronchoscopy has not been previously performed for diagnosis or staging, bronchoscopy should be performed during the planned 
surgical resection, rather than as a separate procedure.
Bronchoscopy is required before surgical resection (NSCL-2).
A separate bronchoscopy may not be needed for treatment decisions before the time of surgery and adds time, costs, and procedural risk.
A preoperative bronchoscopy may be appropriate if a central tumor requires pre-resection evaluation for biopsy, surgical planning (eg, 
potential sleeve resection), or preoperative airway preparation (eg, coring out an obstructive lesion).
A preoperative bronchoscopy may also be preferred for tissue diagnosis and/or mediastinal staging (EBUS).
• Invasive mediastinal staging is recommended before surgical resection for most patients with clinical stage I or II lung cancer except for 
peripheral clinical stage I tumors with no suspicious nodes on chest CT or FDG-PET/CT (NSCL-2 and NSCL-3). For patients undergoing 
EBUS/endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) staging, this most commonly should be a separate procedure to allow for pathologic evaluation.
Patients having mediastinoscopy should preferably undergo invasive mediastinal staging (mediastinoscopy) as the initial step before the 
planned resection (during the same anesthetic procedure), rather than as a separate procedure. 
A separate staging procedure adds time, costs, coordination of care, inconvenience, and an additional anesthetic risk.
Preoperative invasive mediastinal staging may be appropriate for a strong clinical suspicion of N2 or N3 nodal disease or when 
intraoperative cytology or frozen section analysis is not available.
• In patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), many techniques are available for tissue diagnosis. 
Diagnostic tools that should be routinely available include:
 ◊Sputum cytology
 ◊Bronchoscopy with biopsy and transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA)
 ◊Image-guided transthoracic needle core biopsy (preferred) or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) 
 ◊Thoracentesis
 ◊Mediastinoscopy
 ◊Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open surgical biopsy
 ◊Left anterior mediastinotomy/Chamberlain
Diagnostic tools that provide important additional strategies for biopsy include:
 ◊EBUS–guided biopsy 
 ◊EUS–guided biopsy
 ◊Navigational bronchoscopy
 ◊Robotic bronchoscopy
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 24 ===
PRINCIPLES OF DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION
• The preferred diagnostic strategy for an individual patient depends on the size and location of the tumor, the presence of mediastinal or 
distant disease, patient characteristics (such as pulmonary pathology and/or other significant comorbidities), and local experience and 
expertise. 
Factors to be considered in choosing the optimal diagnostic step include:
 ◊Anticipated diagnostic yield (sensitivity)
 ◊Diagnostic accuracy including specificity and particularly the reliability of a negative diagnostic study (ie, true negative)
 ◊Adequate volume of tissue specimen for diagnosis and molecular testing
 ◊Invasiveness and risk of procedure
 ◊Efficiency of evaluation	
– Access and timeliness of procedure
– Concomitant staging is beneficial, because it avoids additional biopsies or procedures. It is preferable to biopsy the pathology that 
would confer the highest stage (ie, to biopsy a suspected metastasis or mediastinal lymph node rather than the pulmonary lesion). 
Therefore, FDG-PET/CT imaging is frequently best performed before a diagnostic biopsy site is chosen in cases of high clinical 
suspicion for aggressive, advanced-stage tumors.
 ◊Technologies and expertise available
 ◊Tumor viability at proposed biopsy site from FDG-PET/CT imaging
Decisions about the optimal diagnostic steps for suspected stage I to III lung cancer should be made by thoracic radiologists, 
interventional radiologists, thoracic surgeons, and pulmonologists who devote a significant portion of their practice to thoracic oncology. 
Multidisciplinary evaluation should also include a pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon with expertise in advanced bronchoscopic techniques 
for diagnosis. The least invasive biopsy with the highest yield is preferred as the first diagnostic study.
 ◊Patients with central masses and suspected endobronchial involvement should undergo bronchoscopy.
 ◊Patients with pulmonary nodules may benefit from navigational bronchoscopy (including robotic), radial EBUS, or transthoracic needle 
aspiration (TTNA).
 ◊Patients with suspected nodal disease should be biopsied by EBUS, EUS, navigational bronchoscopy, or mediastinoscopy.
– EBUS provides access to nodal stations 2R/2L, 3P, 4R/4L, 7, 10R/10L, 11–13, and other hilar nodal stations if necessary.
– An EBUS-TBNA negative for malignancy in a clinically (FDG-PET/CT and/or CT) positive mediastinum should undergo subsequent 
mediastinoscopy prior to surgical resection.
– EUS–guided biopsy provides additional access to stations 3P, 5, 7, 8, and 9 lymph nodes if these are clinically suspicious.
– TTNA and anterior mediastinotomy (ie, Chamberlain procedure) provide additional access to anterior mediastinal (stations 3a, 5, and 6) 
lymph nodes. If TTNA is not possible due to proximity to aorta, VATS biopsy is also an option. 
 ◊EUS also provides reliable access to the left adrenal gland.
 ◊Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE), when available, helps to increase diagnostic and molecular yield. 
 ◊Patients with lung cancer with an associated pleural effusion should undergo thoracentesis and cytology. A negative pleural cytology 
result does not exclude pleural involvement. Thoracoscopic evaluation of the pleura should be considered before starting curative intent 
therapy if pleural fluid is a lymphocytic exudate with negative pleural fluid cytology.
 ◊Patients suspected of having a solitary site of metastatic disease should have tissue confirmation of that site if feasible.
 ◊Patients suspected of having metastatic disease should have confirmation from one of the metastatic sites if feasible.
 ◊Patients who may have multiple sites of metastatic disease—based on a strong clinical suspicion—should have biopsy of the primary 
lung lesion or mediastinal lymph nodes if it is technically difficult or very risky to biopsy a metastatic site.

The image provides guidance on the initial evaluation and clinical staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It outlines the pathologic diagnosis process, which involves a pathology review, assessment of performance status and weight loss, imaging studies like CT scans of the chest and abdomen, and blood tests like CBC and chemistry profile. Based on these evaluations, the cancer is assigned a clinical stage from IA to IV, including substages, which determines the appropriate pretreatment evaluation pathway to follow per the NSCL guidelines. The guidance recommends using the 5 A's framework of Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange, integrating palliative care, and consulting additional NCCN guidelines for assessing and managing NSCLC in older adults when applicable. The pretreatment evaluation pathways correspond to different clinical stage groupings.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 25 ===
For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) management, initial evaluation includes pathology review, H&P with performance status and weight loss assessment, CT chest and upper abdomen with contrast, CBC, platelets, chemistry profile, smoking cessation advice, and palliative care integration. The 5 A's Framework (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) is recommended. Clinical staging determines the pretreatment evaluation pathway, ranging from NSCL-2 for Stage IA to NSCL-15 for Stage IVA, M1b and IVB, M1c. Stages are defined by tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. Special considerations include separate pulmonary nodules, multiple lung cancers, and pleural or pericardial effusion. Advanced/metastatic disease (NSCL-19) is indicated for pleural or disseminated metastases. The guideline notes that HIV status alone should not dictate treatment modifications and that multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended for cases where multiple treatment modalities are considered.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 26 ===
For Stage IA (peripheral T1, N0) non-small cell lung cancer, pretreatment evaluation includes pulmonary function tests, bronchoscopy (intraoperative preferred), consideration of pathologic lymph node evaluation, and FDG-PET/CT scan if not previously done. If mediastinal nodes are negative, the patient is considered operable and undergoes surgical resection with lymph node dissection or systematic lymph node sampling, followed by assessment of findings at surgery. If mediastinal nodes are positive, the patient is staged as IIB/IIIA/IIIB or IIIB/IIIC. For medically inoperable patients or those at high surgical risk, definitive radiation therapy, preferably SABR, is recommended, followed by surveillance. The choice of tests and treatments depends on clinical circumstances and institutional processes, with surgical resection being the first option for operable patients with negative nodes, though SABR may be discussed as an alternative through shared decision-making.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 27 ===
For non-small cell lung cancer stages IB to IIIA, pretreatment evaluation includes perioperative therapy assessment, biomarker testing (EGFR, ALK, PD-L1), PFTs, bronchoscopy, lymph node evaluation, FDG-PET/CT scan, and brain MRI for certain stages. Treatment paths diverge based on N-stage: N0 or N1 cases deemed operable undergo surgical resection with lymph node dissection or systematic lymph node sampling after preoperative systemic therapy, if planned. Medically inoperable or high-risk N0 cases receive definitive radiotherapy, preferably SABR followed by consideration of adjuvant systemic therapy for high-risk stage II. N1 cases are directed to NSCL-10 protocol. N2 or N3 cases proceed to stage IIB/IIIA/IIIB or IIIB/IIIC protocols. Post-surgery, findings guide further management (NSCL-4), while completed treatments lead to surveillance (NSCL-17). Various diagnostic methods and principles for surgical, radiation, and systemic therapies are referenced for detailed guidance.

This flowchart outlines adjuvant treatment guidelines for non-small cell lung cancer based on stage and surgical findings. For Stage IA, observation is recommended if margins are negative, while reresection or RT is preferred for positive margins. Stage IB with negative margins allows for observation or adjuvant systemic therapy, while positive margins suggest reresection or RT, possibly with systemic therapy. Stage IIA follows similar guidelines to IB. For Stage IIB, adjuvant systemic therapy is recommended for negative margins, while positive margins (R1 or R2) call for reresection with systemic therapy or various chemoradiation options. Stage IIIA/IIIB with negative margins suggests adjuvant systemic therapy or sequential chemotherapy with RT consideration, while positive margins indicate chemoradiation treatments. All paths ultimately lead to surveillance as outlined in NSCL-17.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 30 ===
For non-small cell lung cancer patients with Stage IIB (T3 invasion, N0) or Stage IIIA (T3 invasion, N1; T4 invasion, size N0-1), pretreatment evaluation includes perioperative therapy assessment, biomarker testing (EGFR, ALK, PD-L1), PFTs, bronchoscopy, pathologic lymph node evaluation, brain MRI, MRI of spine and thoracic inlet for superior sulcus lesions, and FDG-PET/CT scan. Clinical evaluation then determines treatment based on tumor location and stage: superior sulcus tumors (NSCL-6), chest wall/trachea/carina/mediastinum/diaphragm involvement or Stage IIIA (T4, N0-1) (NSCL-7), positive mediastinal nodes (N2) for various Stage II and III subtypes (NSCL-8 or NSCL-14), Stage IIIC with positive mediastinal nodes (N3) (NSCL-13 or NSCL-14), and metastatic disease (NSCL-15 for limited sites or NSCL-18 for distant disease).
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 31 ===
For superior sulcus non-small cell lung cancer, treatment varies based on tumor stage and resectability. T3N0-1 tumors undergo preoperative concurrent chemoradiation followed by surgery and adjuvant systemic therapy. T4N0-1 tumors are evaluated for resectability. If possibly resectable, patients receive preoperative concurrent chemoradiation, then surgical reevaluation with imaging. Resectable cases proceed to surgery and adjuvant systemic therapy, while unresectable cases receive complete definitive chemoradiation. Initially unresectable T4N0-1 tumors are treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiation. Post-treatment, patients may receive durvalumab (if no EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) or osimertinib (if EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation present). All treatment paths conclude with surveillance as outlined in NSCL-17 guidelines. Treatment decisions should follow principles of surgical therapy, radiation therapy, and concurrent chemoradiation regimens as referenced in the image.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 32 ===
For non-small cell lung cancer treatment, the approach depends on the clinical presentation and stage. For resectable chest wall, trachea/carina, mediastinum, or diaphragm involvement (T3 invasion, N0-1; resectable T4 invasion, N0-1), or Stage IIIA (T4 [size], N0-1) resectable cases, initial treatment involves surgery or systemic therapy with concurrent chemoradiation. Post-surgery, treatment paths vary based on margin status: negative margins lead to adjuvant systemic therapy, while positive margins require additional interventions like reresection, chemoradiation, or systemic therapy. For Stage IIIA (T4, N0-1) unresectable cases, definitive concurrent chemoradiation is recommended, followed by durvalumab or osimertinib based on EGFR mutation status. All treatment paths conclude with surveillance as outlined in NSCL-17. The flowchart provides detailed guidance on surgical principles, radiation therapy, perioperative systemic therapy, and specific treatment regimens for various scenarios.

=== PAGE 33 ===
This flowchart outlines the pretreatment evaluation and treatment pathways for non-small cell lung cancer based on clinical assessment and mediastinal biopsy findings. For stages IIB, IIIA, and IIIB, pretreatment evaluation includes perioperative therapy assessment, biomarker testing (EGFR, ALK, PD-L1), PFTs, bronchoscopy, pathologic lymph node evaluation, FDG-PET/CT scan, and brain MRI. Treatment is then determined by mediastinal biopsy results: negative nodes follow NSCL-9, N1/N2 positive nodes with M0 follow NSCL-10, N3 positive nodes with M0 lead to Stage IIIB/IIIC (NSCL-13), and metastatic disease is treated according to NSCL-15 (limited metastasis) or NSCL-18 (distant metastasis). For separate pulmonary nodules (IIB, IIIA, or IV) or ipsilateral non-primary lobe involvement stage IIIA (T4, N0-1) and IV, similar pretreatment evaluations are conducted, with outcomes leading to treatment via NSCL-11 for same lobe or ipsilateral non-primary lobe involvement, NSCL-11 for contralateral lung solitary nodules, or metastatic disease protocols (NSCL-15/18) for extrathoracic metastases.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 34 ===
This flowchart outlines the treatment approach for non-small cell lung cancer based on mediastinal biopsy findings. For T1, N0 patients, if operable, surgical resection with lymph node dissection or sampling is performed, followed by evaluation of findings at surgery (NSCL-4). If medically inoperable or high surgical risk, definitive radiotherapy (preferably SABR) is recommended, followed by surveillance (NSCL-17). For T2a-3, N0 patients, a similar approach is taken for operable cases. For inoperable T2a-3, N0 cases, definitive radiotherapy (preferably SABR for T2a) is recommended, with consideration of adjuvant systemic therapy for high-risk stage II (especially T2b-3), followed by surveillance (NSCL- 17). The flowchart notes that surgical resection is the first option for operable patients with negative nodes, but SABR may be discussed as an alternative. Additional notes provide information on principles of surgical therapy, radiation therapy, and other treatment options like IGTA therapy and multidisciplinary evaluation for determining the most appropriate approach.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 35 ===
For patients with non-small cell lung cancer staged T1-3 with N1 nodes positive and M0, if operable, the preferred initial treatment is neoadjuvant systemic therapy followed by surgical resection with lymph node dissection or systematic sampling, or alternatively surgical resection with lymph node dissection or systematic sampling alone, with findings at surgery directing to NSCL-4. For patients who are medically inoperable, have high surgical risk as determined by thoracic surgeon, or decline surgery after thoracic surgical consultation, definitive concurrent chemoradiation (category 1) is recommended, followed by adjuvant treatment with either Durvalumab (if no EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) for category 1 stage III or category 2A stage II, or Osimertinib (if EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) for category 1 stage III or category 2A stage II, then proceeding to surveillance (NSCL-17).

For patients staged T1-3 with N2 nodes positive and M0, treatment options include definitive concurrent chemoradiation (category 1) followed by Durvalumab (if no EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation, category 1) or Osimertinib (if EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation, category 1), then surveillance (NSCL-17). Alternatively, systemic therapy with or without radiation therapy may be considered. If no apparent progression occurs, surgery may be performed with findings directing to NSCL-4, or radiation therapy may be considered leading to surveillance (NSCL-17). If progression occurs, local progression may be treated with radiation therapy if feasible plus or minus systemic therapy, while systemic progression directs to treatment for metastasis at limited sites (NSCL-15) or distant disease (NSCL-18). Resectability should be determined by thoracic surgery evaluation prior to therapy initiation, and multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended when multiple treatment modalities are considered. Chest CT with contrast and/or FDG-PET/CT should be used to evaluate progression.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 36 ===
For non-small cell lung cancer clinical presentations, patients with separate pulmonary nodule(s) in the same lobe (T3, N0-1) or ipsilateral non-primary lobe (T4, N0-1) should undergo surgery after preoperative systemic therapy if planned, with findings at surgery detailed in NSCL-4. For Stage IVA (N0, M1a) patients with a contralateral lung solitary nodule, treatment should proceed as two primary lung tumors if both are curable, following Initial Evaluation (NSCL-1). When multiple lung cancers are suspected based on biopsy-proven synchronous lesions or history of lung cancer, workup includes chest CT with contrast, FDG-PET/CT scan if not previously done, and brain MRI with and without contrast (or CT of head with contrast if MRI is not possible). If disease is found outside of chest, proceed to advanced/metastatic disease management (NSCL-19). If no disease is found outside of chest, pathologic lymph node evaluation should be performed using methods including mediastinoscopy, mediastinotomy, EBUS, EUS, and CT-guided biopsy; if lymph node status is N0-1, proceed to Initial Treatment (NSCL-12), and if N2-3, proceed to advanced/metastatic disease (NSCL-19). Lesions with different cell types are usually different primary tumors, and multigene panel testing (MGPT) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) may help determine clonal relatedness among separate lung nodules. Additional guidance references include Principles of Surgical Therapy (NSCL-B), Principles of Perioperative Systemic Therapy (NSCL-E), and diagnostic evaluation of suspicious pulmonary nodules (DIAG-1).
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 37 ===
For patients with multiple lung cancers (suspected or confirmed) with N0-1 nodal status, multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended, referencing NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening (LCS-11). This evaluation should include thoracic radiology, pulmonary medicine, thoracic surgery, medical oncology, and radiation oncology.If its stable or very slow-growing disease, it may be observed with subsequent surveillance (NSCL-17). When a dominant nodule with evidence of growth is identified, treatment pathways depend on, If definitive local therapy is possible, options include parenchymal-sparing resection (preferred), radiation, or image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA) such as cryotherapy, microwave, or radiofrequency for select patients, followed by surveillance (NSCL-17). Lung-sparing resection is preferred, but tumor distribution and institutional expertise should guide individual treatment planning. If definitive local therapy is not possible, palliative systemic therapy with or without local palliative therapy, or observation, may be considered, leading to therapy for recurrence and metastasis (NSCL-18) or management as advanced/metastatic disease (NSCL-19). Lesions at low risk of becoming symptomatic (such as small subsolid nodules with slow growth) can be observed; however, treatment should be considered if lesions show accelerating growth, increasing solid component, or increasing FDG uptake, even while small.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 38 ===
For patients with Stage IIIB (T1-2, N3) or Stage IIIC (T3, N3) non-small cell lung cancer, pretreatment evaluation should include biomarker testing including EGFR, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) if not previously done, FDG-PET/CT scan from skull base to mid-thigh if not previously done, and brain MRI with and without contrast (or CT of head with contrast if MRI is not possible). Pathologic confirmation of N3 disease should be obtained through mediastinoscopy, supraclavicular lymph node biopsy, thoracoscopy, needle biopsy, mediastinotomy, EUS biopsy, or EBUS biopsy. If N3 is negative, patients should proceed to initial treatment for stage I-IIIA (NSCL-8). If N3 is positive, patients should receive definitive concurrent chemoradiation (category 1), followed by either Durvalumab (if no EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation) as category 1 recommendation, or Osimertinib (if EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation is present) as category 1 recommendation, then proceed to surveillance (NSCL-17). For patients who received sequential chemoradiation, durvalumab can be considered as consolidation immunotherapy, or if EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation is present, osimertinib is recommended. If metastatic disease is found, patients should receive treatment for metastasis at limited sites(NSCL-15) or distant disease(NSCL-18).
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 39 ===
For patients with Stage IIIB (T4, N2) or Stage IIIC (T4, N3) non-small cell lung cancer, pretreatment evaluation should include biomarker testing including EGFR, FDG-PET/CT scan if not previously done, brain MRI with and without contrast, and pathologic confirmation of N2-3 disease by mediastinoscopy, supraclavicular lymph node biopsy, thoracoscopy, needle biopsy, mediastinotomy, EUS biopsy, or EBUS biopsy. If contralateral mediastinal node is negative with ipsilateral mediastinal node negative (T4, N0-1), treatment follows Stage IIIA guidelines (NSCL-7). If contralateral mediastinal node is negative with ipsilateral mediastinal node positive (T4, N2), or if contralateral mediastinal node is positive (T4, N3), patients should receive definitive concurrent chemoradiation (category 1) per Principles of Radiation Therapy (NSCL-C) and Concurrent Chemoradiation Regimens (NSCL-F), followed by either Durvalumab (if no EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation, category 1) or Osimertinib (if EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation, category 1), then surveillance (NSCL-17). If metastatic disease is found, see Treatment for Metastasis limited sites (NSCL-15) or distant disease (NSCL-18). For Stage IVA, M1a with pleural or pericardial effusion, evaluation includes FDG-PET/CT scan if not previously done, brain MRI with and without contrast, biomarker testing (NSCL-19), and thoracentesis or pericardiocentesis with possible thoracoscopy if indeterminate. If negative, treatment proceeds according to TNM stage; if positive, local therapy such as pleurodesis, ambulatory small catheter drainage, or pericardial window may be needed plus treatment for stage IV disease solitary site or distant disease (NSCL-19).
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 40 ===
For patients with Stage IVA, M1b and Stage IVB, M1c non-small cell lung cancer, pretreatment evaluation should include biomarker testing (NSCL-19) if not previously done, brain MRI with and without contrast (or CT of head with contrast if MRI is not possible), FDG-PET/CT scan performed from skull base to mid-thigh, and pathologic confirmation of metastatic lesion if possible. For patients with performance status (PS) 0–2 who have solitary or limited metastases confirmed (including selected patients with stage M1c and limited number and volume of metastatic lesions amenable to definitive local therapy, with clinical trials including up to 3 to 5 metastatic sites), treatment depends on the site of metastasis: if the metastasis is in the brain, initial treatment consists of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone or surgical resection if symptomatic or warranted for diagnosis, followed by SRS or whole brain RT (WBRT), then proceed to Treatment of Thoracic Disease (NSCL-16); if the metastasis is at another site, proceed to Treatment of Thoracic Disease (NSCL-16). For patients with PS 0–2 who have multiple lesions, treatment follows the advanced/metastatic disease pathway (NSCL-19). For patients with PS 3–4, treatment also follows the advanced/metastatic disease pathway (NSCL-19). Positive FDG-PET/CT scan findings for mediastinal nodal or distant disease need pathologic or other radiologic confirmation, and if positive in the mediastinum, lymph node status needs pathologic confirmation.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 41 ===
For treatment of thoracic disease in non-small cell lung cancer, when definitive therapy for thoracic disease is feasible, clinicians should consider systemic therapy as per advanced/metastatic disease guidelines (NSCL-19) and restaging with chest CT with contrast and/or FDG-PET/CT to confirm non-progression, or proceed to definitive therapy. For T1–3, N0 disease, pathologic nodal evaluation using methods such as mediastinoscopy, mediastinotomy, EBUS, EUS, and CT-guided biopsy should be performed, followed by surgical resection (NSCL-B) or SABR (NSCL-C, NSCL-D). For T1–3, N1 disease, pathologic nodal evaluation and chemoradiation (NSCL-F) is preferred, or surgical resection (NSCL-B) or definitive RT (NSCL-C) may be considered. For T1–3, N2 or T4, N0–2 disease, definitive chemoradiation (NSCL-F) is recommended. Following these treatments, definitive local therapy for the metastatic site should be given if not already provided, typically using RT including SABR or surgical resection (NSCL-C, NSCL-D), and systemic therapy should be considered if not already given as per advanced/metastatic disease guidelines (NSCL-19). IGTA therapy such as cryotherapy, microwave, or radiofrequency may be an option for select patients (NSCL-D). An EBUS-TBNA negative for malignancy in a clinically positive mediastinum (FDG-PET/CT and/or CT) should undergo subsequent mediastinoscopy prior to surgical resection. When definitive therapy for thoracic disease is not feasible, patients should be managed according to advanced/metastatic disease guidelines (NSCL-19).

For patients with non-small cell lung cancer who show no evidence of clinical or radiographic disease after completing definitive therapy, surveillance recommendations vary by stage and treatment type. For Stage I–II patients whose primary treatment included surgery with or without systemic therapy, history and physical examination (H&P) and chest CT with or without contrast should be performed every 6 months for 2–3 years, followed by H&P and a low-dose non-contrast-enhanced chest CT annually. For Stage I–II patients whose primary treatment included radiation therapy (RT), or Stage III or Stage IV oligometastatic patients treated with definitive intent, H&P and chest CT with or without contrast should be performed every 3–6 months for 3 years, then H&P and chest CT with or without contrast every 6 months for 2 years, followed by H&P and a low-dose non-contrast-enhanced chest CT annually; residual or new radiographic abnormalities may require more frequent imaging. All patients should receive smoking cessation advice, counseling, and pharmacotherapy. FDG-PET/CT is not routinely indicated. Brain MRI with and without contrast is clinically indicated based on risk assessment, with high-risk factors including EGFR mutations, ALK gene fusions, and node-positive disease. Cancer Survivorship Care guidance is available (NSCL-G). If recurrence is detected, patients should undergo FDG-PET/CT and brain MRI with and without contrast (CT of head with contrast if MRI is not possible). If locoregional recurrence or distant metastases are identified, patients should proceed to Therapy for Recurrence and Metastasis (NSCL-18).

# Therapy for Recurrence and Metastasis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

For locoregional recurrence or symptomatic local disease, management depends on the specific presentation. Endobronchial obstruction can be treated with any combination of laser/stent/other surgery (NSCL-B), external-beam RT or brachytherapy (NSCL-C), or photodynamic therapy. Resectable recurrence is managed with reresection (preferred) (NSCL-B) or external-beam RT or SABR (NSCL-C), with IGTA therapy (cryotherapy, microwave, radiofrequency) as an option for select patients (NSCL-D). For mediastinal lymph node recurrence, patients with no prior RT receive concurrent chemoradiation (NSCL-C, NSCL-F), while those with prior RT are treated as advanced/metastatic disease (NSCL-19). Superior vena cava obstruction is managed with concurrent chemoradiation if not previously given, with or without SVC stent (NSCL-C, NSCL-F), external-beam RT with or without SVC stent (NSCL-C), or SVC stent alone. Severe hemoptysis can be treated with any combination of external-beam RT or brachytherapy (NSCL-C), laser or photodynamic therapy or embolization, or surgery. Following treatment, imaging with chest CT with contrast, brain MRI with and without contrast (or CT head with contrast if MRI not possible), and FDG-PET/CT is performed; if no evidence of disseminated disease, observation or advanced/metastatic disease management (NSCL-19, category 2B) follows, while evidence of disseminated disease leads to advanced/metastatic disease treatment (NSCL-19).

For distant metastases, localized symptoms are treated with palliative external-beam RT (NSCL-C). Diffuse brain metastases receive palliative external-beam RT (NSCL-C, NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers). Bone metastasis management includes orthopedic stabilization plus palliative external-beam RT if fracture risk exists (NSCL-C), with consideration of bisphosphonate therapy or denosumab (FDA-approved biosimilar is appropriate substitute). Limited metastasis is managed as Stage IVA, M1b and stage IVB, M1c (NSCL-15). Pleural metastases or disseminated metastases are treated as advanced/metastatic disease (NSCL-19), which is also the pathway following management of the above distant metastases scenarios (NSCL-19).

For patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the initial approach involves establishing histologic subtype with adequate tissue for biomarker testing, considering rebiopsy or plasma testing if appropriate, providing smoking cessation counseling, and integrating palliative care (NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care). Based on histologic subtype, biomarker testing recommendations differ. For adenocarcinoma, large cell, or NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS), biomarker testing should include EGFR mutation (category 1), ALK (category 1), KRAS, BRAF, NTRK1/2/3, MET exon 14 skipping, RET (category 1), ERBB2 (HER2), NRG1, HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HGFR (MET) IHC, with testing conducted as part of multigene panel testing (MGPT) along with PD-L1 testing (category 1), leading to Testing Results (NSCL-20). For squamous cell carcinoma, biomarker testing should be considered including EGFR mutation, ALK, KRAS, ROS1, BRAF, NTRK1/2/3, MET exon 14 skipping, RET, ERBB2 (HER2), NRG1, and HER2 (IHC), with testing conducted as part of MGPT and PD-L1 testing (category 1), also leading to Testing Results (NSCL-20). Complete biomarker testing should include molecular assessment of EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, NTRK1/2/3, MET, RET, ERBB2 (HER2), and NRG1 via biopsy and/or plasma testing, with concurrent or sequential testing acceptable. During initial evaluation, priority should be PD-L1 testing and MGPT, with additional testing such as HER2 IHC or HGFR (MET) IHC if tissue allows. The NCCN NSCLC Guidelines Panel strongly advises MGPT to identify rare driver mutations for which effective drugs may be available.

For patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation, first-line therapy recommendations depend on when the mutation is discovered. If the EGFR mutation is discovered prior to first-line systemic therapy, preferred options include Osimertinib (category 1), or Carboplatin or Cisplatin combined with Osimertinib/Pemetrexed for nonsquamous histology (category 1), or Lazertinib plus Amivantamab-vmjw (category 1); upon progression with Osimertinib or Lazertinib plus Amivantamab-vmjw, patients proceed to subsequent therapy (NSCL-22), while progression on the platinum-based combination leads to systemic therapy subsequent (NSCL-K 5 of 6). Useful in certain circumstances options include Afatinib (category 1), Dacomitinib (category 1), Erlotinib (category 1), Erlotinib plus Bevacizumab, Erlotinib plus Ramucirumab, Gefitinib (category 1), or Lazertinib; upon progression with most of these agents, patients proceed to subsequent therapy (NSCL-23), except Lazertinib which leads to subsequent therapy (NSCL-22). If the EGFR mutation is discovered during first-line systemic therapy, clinicians should interrupt current therapy and start therapy as noted above, or add Osimertinib to Carboplatin or Cisplatin/Pemetrexed for nonsquamous histology; upon progression, patients proceed to systemic therapy subsequent (NSCL-K 5 of 6). Prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended when initiating Lazertinib plus Amivantamab-vmjw to prevent venous thromboembolic events, along with prophylaxis using oral doxycycline or minocycline and dermatologic measures to reduce adverse events.

For patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation who experience progression on Osimertinib or Lazertinib ± Amivantamab-vmjw, subsequent therapy depends on whether disease is asymptomatic or symptomatic, and the site of progression. For asymptomatic patients, consider definitive local therapy (eg, SABR or surgery) for limited lesions and continue Osimertinib or Lazertinib ± Amivantamab-vmjw. For symptomatic patients with brain metastases, consider definitive local therapy (eg, SRS), continue Osimertinib or Lazertinib ± Amivantamab-vmjw, and refer to NCCN Guidelines for CNS Cancers; if progression occurs, see therapy for multiple lesions. For symptomatic systemic disease with limited progression, consider definitive local therapy (eg, SABR or surgery), continue Osimertinib or Lazertinib ± Amivantamab-vmjw, or proceed to therapy for multiple lesions. For multiple lesions, preferred treatment (category 1) for nonsquamous histology is Carboplatin/Pemetrexed + Amivantamab-vmjw if not previously given; alternatively, Lazertinib + Amivantamab-vmjw (if not previously given) is useful in certain circumstances, though this is not an option for EGFR S768I, L861Q, and/or G719X mutations. Systemic therapy options include Afatinib + Cetuximab for patients with disease progression on EGFR TKI therapy; PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy is less effective irrespective of PD-L1 expression in EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation. Upon further progression, proceed to subsequent systemic therapy (NSCL-K 5 of 6). IGTA therapy (cryotherapy, microwave, radiofrequency) may be an option for select patients [Principles of Image-Guided Thermal Ablation Therapy (NSCL-D)]. Prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended at initiation to prevent venous thromboembolic events. Prophylaxis with oral doxycycline or minocycline, clindamycin lotion to scalp, chlorhexidine to nails, and ceramide-based non-comedogenic moisturizer is recommended to reduce dermatologic adverse events; oral dexamethasone 8 mg for 2 days prior to first dose reduces IRRs with amivantamab-vmjw. Beware of flare phenomenon in patients discontinuing TKI; if disease flare occurs, restart TKI.

For patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation who experience progression on Afatinib, Dacomitinib, Erlotinib (± Bevacizumab or Ramucirumab), or Gefitinib, T790M testing is recommended (category 1). Subsequent therapy options depend on symptom status and T790M results. For asymptomatic patients, if T790M positive, Osimertinib (category 1, for PS 0-4) is recommended, with progression leading to (NSCL-22); if T790M negative, continue Afatinib, Dacomitinib, Gefitinib, or Erlotinib (± Bevacizumab or Ramucirumab) and consider definitive local therapy such as SABR or surgery for limited lesions followed by steps of therapy for multiple lessions. For symptomatic brain involvement, if T790M positive, Osimertinib (category 1) is recommended; if T790M negative, continue the current TKI regimen and consider definitive local therapy such as SRS, with reference to NCCN Guidelines for CNS Cancers. For symptomatic systemic disease with limited progression, continue Afatinib, Dacomitinib, Gefitinib, or Erlotinib (if T790M negative), consider definitive local therapy such as SABR or surgery, or proceed to therapy for multiple lesions. For multiple lesions, if T790M positive, Osimertinib (category 1, if not previously given) is recommended with progression to (NSCL-22); if T790M negative, systemic therapy is indicated (NSCL-K 1 of 6). Afatinib plus Cetuximab may be considered for disease progression on EGFR TKI therapy.

For patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR S768I, L861Q, and/or G719X mutations, first-line therapy recommendations depend on when the mutation is discovered. If the EGFR mutation is discovered prior to first-line systemic therapy, preferred options include Afatinib or Osimertinib; upon progression with Afatinib, patients should proceed to Subsequent Therapy (NSCL-23), while progression on Osimertinib leads to Subsequent Therapy (NSCL-22). Other recommended options include Dacomitinib, Erlotinib, or Gefitinib, with progression leading to Subsequent Therapy (NSCL-23). If the EGFR mutation is discovered during first-line systemic therapy, current therapy should be interrupted and treatment started with Afatinib (preferred), Osimertinib (preferred), Dacomitinib, Erlotinib, or Gefitinib; progression on Afatinib leads to Subsequent Therapy (NSCL-23), progression on Osimertinib leads to Subsequent Therapy (NSCL-22), and progression on Dacomitinib, Erlotinib, or Gefitinib leads to Subsequent Therapy (NSCL-23). All drug options are indicated for PS 0–4. If systemic therapy contains an ICI, physicians should be aware of the long half-life and data reporting adverse events when using osimertinib in combination with or following checkpoint inhibitors, with higher pneumonitis rates within 3 months.

For patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation, first-line therapy options include either carboplatin/pemetrexed plus amivantamab-vmjw (category 1, preferred) for nonsquamous disease, or systemic therapy as outlined in NSCL-K 1 of 6. If the preferred first-line regimen is used and progression occurs, subsequent therapy options include sunvozertinib, or systemic therapy subsequent (NSCL-K 5 of 6); upon further progression, patients may receive amivantamab-vmjw or sunvozertinib, and if progression continues, options include amivantamab-vmjw (if not received previously), sunvozertinib, or systemic therapy subsequent (NSCL-K 5 of 6), with continued progression leading to systemic therapy subsequent (NSCL-K 5 of 6). If the alternative first-line systemic therapy path is chosen, tumor response evaluation follows; if response or stable disease is achieved, 4-6 cycles total are administered followed by another tumor response evaluation. If progression occurs at this point, options include amivantamab-vmjw or sunvozertinib; if response or stable disease continues, maintenance therapy (NSCL-K 4 of 6) is given until progression. Prophylaxis with oral doxycycline or minocycline, clindamycin lotion to scalp, chlorhexidine to nails, and ceramide-based moisturizer is recommended to reduce dermatologic adverse events with amivantamab-vmjw, along with oral dexamethasone 8 mg for 2 days prior to first dose to reduce infusion-related reactions.

For patients with KRAS G12C mutation in non-small cell lung cancer, first-line therapy consists of systemic therapy based on PD-L1 expression levels: PD-L1 ≥1% (NSCL-38) or PD-L1 <1% (NSCL-39), followed by tumor response evaluation. If progression occurs after initial systemic therapy, treatment with Adagrasib or Sotorasib is recommended. If this targeted therapy leads to further progression, subsequent systemic therapy should follow (NSCL-K 5 of 6). Alternatively, if tumor response evaluation shows response or stable disease, patients should complete 4–6 cycles total of initial systemic therapy, then undergo another tumor response evaluation. At this point, if progression occurs, Adagrasib or Sotorasib is recommended; if response or stable disease continues, maintenance therapy should be initiated (NSCL-K 4 of 6), with Adagrasib or Sotorasib reserved for subsequent progression. In general, 4 cycles of initial systemic therapy with carboplatin or cisplatin are administered prior to maintenance therapy, though consideration can be given to continue to 6 cycles if the patient is tolerating therapy well. Sotorasib or Adagrasib may be used after at least one line of therapy (second-line and beyond) if no previous KRAS G12C-targeted therapy has been given.

For patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring ALK gene fusion, treatment recommendations depend on when the fusion is discovered. If ALK gene fusion is discovered prior to first-line systemic therapy, preferred first-line therapy options (all category 1, for PS 0-4) include alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, or lorlatinib; upon progression, subsequent therapy should follow NSCL-28 guidelines. Useful in certain circumstances options include ceritinib (category 1), which upon progression leads to subsequent therapy per NSCL-28, or crizotinib (category 1), which upon progression leads to subsequent therapy per NSCL-29. If ALK gene fusion is discovered during first-line systemic therapy, current therapy should be interrupted and treatment should start with preferred options including alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, or lorlatinib, or alternatively ceritinib or crizotinib; if there is a good response to current therapy, it is reasonable to continue. Upon progression from preferred agents or ceritinib, subsequent therapy follows NSCL-28, while progression on crizotinib follows NSCL-29.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 53 ===
For patients with ALK gene fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer who experience progression on Alectinib, Brigatinib, Ceritinib, Ensartinib, or Lorlatinib, subsequent therapy depends on whether the patient is asymptomatic or symptomatic. For asymptomatic patients, consider definitive local therapy (such as SABR or surgery) for limited lesions and continue Alectinib, Brigatinib, Ceritinib, Ensartinib, or Lorlatinib; Lorlatinib is an option for resistant mutations such as ALK G1202R and L1196M (except compound L1196M/G1202R). For symptomatic patients with brain involvement, consider definitive local therapy (such as SRS), continue the current ALK inhibitor or Lorlatinib, and refer to NCCN Guidelines for CNS Cancers; definitive local therapy of CNS disease can include asymptomatic lesions at risk for symptomatic progression. For symptomatic systemic disease with limited progression (up to 3-5 progressing sites), consider definitive local therapy (SABR or surgery) and continue ALK inhibitor therapy or Lorlatinib, or proceed to therapy for multiple lesions. For multiple lesions, options include Lorlatinib if not previously given, or systemic therapy [NSCL-K 1 of 6].
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 54 ===
For patients with ALK gene fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer who experience progression on crizotinib, subsequent therapy depends on whether progression is asymptomatic or symptomatic. For asymptomatic progression, options include definitive local therapy (such as SABR or surgery) for limited lesions, continuing crizotinib, or switching to alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, ensartinib, or lorlatinib. For symptomatic progression involving the brain, consider definitive local therapy (such as SRS), alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, ensartinib, or lorlatinib, with reference to NCCN Guidelines for CNS Cancers; if progression continues, lorlatinib (if not previously given) or systemic therapy is recommended (NSCL-K 1 of 6). For symptomatic systemic progression, limited progression may be treated with definitive local therapy (SABR or surgery), continuing crizotinib, or therapy for multiple lesions; multiple lesions should be treated with alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, ensartinib, lorlatinib, or systemic therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6).

For patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring ROS1 gene fusion, treatment approach depends on when the fusion is discovered. If ROS1 gene fusion is discovered prior to first-line systemic therapy, preferred first-line therapy options include Crizotinib, Entrectinib, Repotrectinib, or Taletrectinib, with these agents recommended for patients with performance status 0-4; upon progression, patients should proceed to subsequent therapy (NSCL-31). If ROS1 gene fusion is discovered during first-line systemic therapy, current therapy should be interrupted (though if there is a good response to current therapy, it is reasonable to continue) and treatment should be started with Crizotinib, Entrectinib, Repotrectinib, or Taletrectinib; upon progression, patients should proceed to subsequent therapy (NSCL-31). Entrectinib, repotrectinib, or taletrectinib may be better options for patients with brain metastases. Clinicians should beware of flare phenomenon in a subset of patients who discontinue TKI; if disease flare occurs, TKI should be restarted.

For patients with ROS1 gene fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer who experience progression on Entrectinib, Crizotinib, Repotrectinib, or Taletrectinib, subsequent therapy depends on symptom status and disease location. For asymptomatic patients, consider definitive local therapy such as SABR or surgery for limited lesions, continue Crizotinib, Entrectinib, Repotrectinib, or Taletrectinib, or switch to Repotrectinib if not previously given, Taletrectinib if not previously given, or Lorlatinib. For symptomatic patients with brain involvement, consider definitive local therapy such as SRS, with preferred options being Repotrectinib if not previously given, Taletrectinib if not previously given, or Lorlatinib (preferred), or Entrectinib (useful in certain circumstances if previously treated with crizotinib), or clinical trial; refer to NCCN Guidelines for CNS Cancers. For symptomatic patients with systemic disease and limited progression, consider definitive local therapy such as SABR or surgery, continue Entrectinib, Crizotinib, Repotrectinib, or Taletrectinib, or use therapy for multiple lesions. For multiple systemic lesions, options include Repotrectinib if not previously given, Taletrectinib if not previously given, Lorlatinib, or systemic therapy options (NSCL-K 1 of 6). Repotrectinib or Taletrectinib is an option for resistant mutations such as ROS1 G2032R. Following these treatments, patients may proceed to Progression, Systemic Therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6).

For patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring a BRAF V600E mutation, treatment pathways depend on when the mutation is discovered. If the BRAF V600E mutation is discovered prior to first-line systemic therapy, the preferred first-line treatment options are Dabrafenib/Trametinib or Binimetinib/Encorafenib (for PS 0-4); useful in certain circumstances are single-agent Dabrafenib or Vemurafenib (for PS 0-4). Upon progression from preferred or useful in certain circumstances therapies, patients should receive systemic therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6). If patients initially receive other recommended systemic therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6) and experience progression, they should then receive Dabrafenib/Trametinib or Binimetinib/Encorafenib. If the BRAF V600E mutation is discovered during first-line systemic therapy, patients may either complete planned systemic therapy including maintenance therapy and then start Dabrafenib/Trametinib or Binimetinib/Encorafenib, or interrupt current therapy and start Dabrafenib/Trametinib or Binimetinib/Encorafenib. For patients who complete planned therapy and start targeted treatment, progression leads to subsequent systemic therapy (NSCL-K 5 of 6). For patients who interrupt current therapy and start targeted treatment, progression leads to systemic therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6). Single-agent vemurafenib or dabrafenib are treatment options if the combination of dabrafenib/trametinib is not tolerated.

For patients with NTRK1/2/3 gene fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer, treatment pathways depend on when the fusion is discovered. If NTRK1/2/3 gene fusion is discovered prior to first-line systemic therapy, the preferred first-line treatment options include Entrectinib, Larotrectinib, or Repotrectinib (for PS 0-4). Upon progression, patients should receive Repotrectinib if not previously given, or systemic therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6). Further progression leads to systemic therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6) or subsequent systemic therapy (NSCL-K 5 of 6). Alternatively, systemic therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6) may be useful in certain circumstances as first-line treatment; upon progression, patients can receive Entrectinib, Larotrectinib, or Repotrectinib, and if progression occurs again, options include Repotrectinib if not previously given, or subsequent systemic therapy (NSCL-K 5 of 6), with further progression leading to subsequent systemic therapy (NSCL-K 5 of 6). If NTRK1/2/3 gene fusion is discovered during first-line systemic therapy, clinicians should interrupt current therapy (though if there is good response to current therapy, it is reasonable to continue) and start Entrectinib, Larotrectinib, or Repotrectinib. Upon progression, patients should receive Repotrectinib if not previously given, or systemic therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6), with subsequent progression leading to systemic therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6).

For patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutation discovered prior to first-line systemic therapy, preferred first-line therapy options include Capmatinib or Tepotinib (for PS 0-4), while Crizotinib (for PS 0-4) is useful in certain circumstances; alternatively, systemic therapy may be considered (NSCL-K 1 of 6). Upon progression following preferred first-line therapy or Crizotinib, patients should proceed to systemic therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6). If progression occurs after initial systemic therapy, preferred subsequent options are Capmatinib or Tepotinib, with Crizotinib useful in certain circumstances; further progression leads to subsequent systemic therapy (NSCL-K 5 of 6). For patients whose MET exon 14 skipping mutation is discovered during first-line systemic therapy, current therapy should be interrupted (though if there is good response to current therapy, it is reasonable to continue) and treatment should start with Capmatinib (preferred), Tepotinib (preferred), or Crizotinib; upon progression, systemic therapy is recommended (NSCL-K 1 of 6). Clinicians should beware of flare phenomenon in patients who discontinue TKI, and if disease flare occurs, TKI should be restarted.

For patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring RET gene fusion, the treatment approach depends on when the fusion is discovered. If RET gene fusion is discovered prior to first-line systemic therapy, the preferred treatment is Pralsetinib or Selpercatinib (category 1), both indicated for PS 0-4. Upon progression, patients should receive either Systemic Therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6) or Cabozantinib; if further progression occurs on Cabozantinib, proceed to Systemic Therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6). If RET gene fusion is discovered during first-line systemic therapy, the recommendation is to interrupt current therapy and start Pralsetinib or Selpercatinib, though if there is a good response to current therapy, it is reasonable to continue therapy. Upon progression, patients should receive either Systemic Therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6) or Cabozantinib; if further progression occurs, proceed to Systemic Therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6).

For patients with ERBB2 (HER2) mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer, first-line therapy involves systemic therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6) followed by tumor response evaluation. Upon progression, preferred subsequent therapy options include Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, Zongertinib, or Sevabertinib, while Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is useful in certain circumstances. If disease progresses again, patients who have not previously received these agents may be treated with Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, Ado-trastuzumab emtansine, Zongertinib, Sevabertinib, or proceed to systemic therapy subsequent (NSCL-K 5 of 6). Further progression leads to systemic therapy subsequent (NSCL-K 5 of 6). Alternatively, if patients achieve response or stable disease, they continue for 4-6 cycles total of initial systemic therapy (typically with carboplatin or cisplatin), with consideration to continue to 6 cycles if tolerating therapy well. After tumor response evaluation following these cycles, if progression occurs, preferred options are Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, Zongertinib, or Sevabertinib, with Ado-trastuzumab emtansine useful in certain circumstances. If response or stable disease continues, patients proceed to maintenance therapy (NSCL-K 4 of 6), and upon subsequent progression, further treatment follows. For HER2 protein overexpression (IHC3+), treatment options are referenced in NSCL-K 5 of 6.

For patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring NRG1 gene fusion, first-line treatment begins with systemic therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6), followed by tumor response evaluation. If progression occurs after initial evaluation, zenocutuzumab-zbco is administered; upon further progression, subsequent systemic therapy is indicated (NSCL-K 5 of 6). If the patient achieves response or stable disease after initial tumor response evaluation, treatment continues for 4–6 cycles total, followed by another tumor response evaluation. At this second evaluation point, if progression occurs, zenocutuzumab-zbco is given, and upon subsequent progression, subsequent systemic therapy follows (NSCL-K 5 of 6). If response or stable disease is observed at the second evaluation, patients proceed to maintenance therapy (NSCL-K 4 of 6), and upon progression from maintenance, subsequent systemic therapy is indicated (NSCL-K 5 of 6). In general, 4 cycles of initial systemic therapy with carboplatin or cisplatin are administered prior to maintenance therapy; however, if the patient is tolerating therapy well, consideration can be given to continue to 6 cycles.

=== PAGE 63 ===
For patients with non-small cell lung cancer who are PD-L1 positive (≥1%), first-line therapy involves biomarker-directed therapy (NSCL-J 1 of 6). For patients who require an urgent start to therapy but biomarker testing is pending, consider holding immunotherapy for one cycle, unless confirmed that no driver mutations are present. Following biomarker-directed therapy, if the patient achieves response or stable disease, continuation maintenance is recommended. If disease progression occurs, patients should receive Systemic Therapy (NSCL-K 1 of 6) or Systemic Therapy, Subsequent (NSCL-K 5 of 6). If the patient has not received platinum-doublet chemotherapy, refer to "systemic therapy"; if the patient received platinum chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1, refer to "subsequent therapy."

For patients with non-small cell lung cancer and PD-L1 <1%, initial systemic therapy should be administered (NSCL-K 1 of 6), followed by tumor response evaluation. If progression occurs after initial evaluation, subsequent systemic therapy should be given (NSCL-K 5 of 6), and if further progression occurs, systemic therapy for progression is indicated (NSCL-K 5 of 6). If the patient demonstrates response or stable disease after initial tumor evaluation, treatment should continue for 4-6 cycles total, followed by another tumor response evaluation. At this second evaluation point, if progression occurs, subsequent systemic therapy is recommended (NSCL-K 5 of 6), which may lead to further progression requiring additional systemic therapy for progression (NSCL-K 5 of 6). If response or stable disease is achieved after 4-6 cycles, maintenance therapy should be initiated (NSCL-K 4 of 6); if progression occurs during maintenance, subsequent systemic therapy is indicated (NSCL-K 5 of 6). In general, 4 cycles of initial systemic therapy (ie, with carboplatin or cisplatin) are administered prior to maintenance therapy; however, if the patient is tolerating therapy well, consideration can be given to continue to 6 cycles.

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW
Pathologic Evaluation
• The purpose of the pathologic evaluation of NSCLC will vary depending on whether the sample 1) is a biopsy or cytology specimen intended 
for initial diagnosis in a case of suspected NSCLC; 2) is a resection specimen; or 3) is obtained for molecular evaluation in the setting of an 
established NSCLC diagnosis.
In small biopsies or cytology specimens intended for initial diagnosis, the primary purpose is a) to make an accurate diagnosis using the 
2021 WHO classification; and b) to preserve the tissue for molecular studies, especially if the patient has advanced-stage disease.
In small biopsies of poorly differentiated carcinomas, the terms "non-small cell carcinoma (NSCC)"1 or "non-small cell carcinoma not 
otherwise specified (NSCC-NOS)" should be used as little as possible and only when a more specific diagnosis is not possible by 
morphology and/or special staining.
The following terms are acceptable: "NSCC favor adenocarcinoma" and "NSCC favor squamous cell carcinoma." "NSCC-NOS" should be 
reserved only for cases in which IHC testing is uninformative or ambiguous (see section on Immunohistochemistry).
Preservation of material for molecular testing is critical. Efforts should be undertaken to minimize block reorientation and the number of 
IHC stains for cases that cannot be classified on histologic examination alone (see section on Immunohistochemistry).
• In resection specimens, the primary purpose is a) to classify the histologic type; and b) to determine all staging parameters, as 
recommended by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), including tumor size, extent of invasion, adequacy of surgical margins, 
and presence or absence of lymph node metastases.
The number of involved lymph node stations should be documented since it has prognostic significance (AJCC 9th ed). Direct extension of 
the primary tumor into an adjacent lymph node is considered as nodal involvement.
All lobectomy specimens should be extensively dissected to search for involved lymph nodes.  
• In small biopsies or cytology specimens—obtained for molecular testing in the context of an established diagnosis after progression on 
targeted therapies—the primary purpose is a) to confirm the original pathologic type with minimal use of tissue for IHC only in suspected 
small cell carcinoma transformation or a different histology; and b) to preserve material for molecular analysis.
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material is suitable for most molecular analyses, except bone biopsies that were previously treated 
with acid decalcifying solutions. Non-acid decalcification approaches may be successful for subsequent molecular testing. While many 
molecular pathology laboratories currently also accept cytopathology specimens such as cell blocks, direct smears, or touch preparations, 
laboratories that do not currently do so are strongly encouraged to identify approaches to testing on non-FFPE cytopathology specimens.

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW

NSCLC Classification
• The types of NSCLC are: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and sarcomatoid 
carcinoma.
Squamous cell carcinoma: A malignant epithelial tumor that either shows keratinization and/or intercellular bridges, or a morphologically 
undifferentiated NSCC that expresses IHC markers of squamous cell differentiation. 
Adenocarcinoma: 
 ◊For small (<3 cm), resected lesions, determining extent of invasion is critical.
	
– Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS; formerly BAC): A small (≤3 cm) localized nodule with lepidic growth, mostly non-mucinous, although 
mucinous types can occur. Multiple synchronous AIS tumors can also occur.
	
– Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA): A small (≤3 cm) solitary adenocarcinoma with a predominantly lepidic pattern and ≤5 mm 
invasion in greatest dimension. MIA is usually non-mucinous, but rarely may be mucinous. MIA is, by definition, solitary and discrete.  
	
– Invasive adenocarcinoma: A malignant epithelial tumor with glandular differentiation, mucin production, or pneumocyte marker 
expression. The tumors show an acinar, papillary, micropapillary, lepidic, or solid growth pattern, with either mucin or pneumocyte 
marker expression. The invasive adenocarcinoma component should be present in at least one focus measuring >5 mm in greatest 
dimension. 
	
– Invasive adenocarcinoma variants: invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, colloid adenocarcinoma, fetal adenocarcinoma, and enteric 
adenocarcinoma.
	
– Refer to College of American Pathologists Protocols for additional information.
Adenosquamous carcinoma: A carcinoma showing components of both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, with each 
component constituting at least 10% of the tumor. Definitive diagnosis requires a resection specimen, although it may be suggested based 
on findings in small biopsies, cytology, or excisional biopsies. Presence of any adenocarcinoma component in a biopsy specimen that is 
otherwise squamous should trigger molecular testing.
Large cell carcinoma: Undifferentiated NSCC that lacks the cytologic, architectural, and histochemical features of small cell carcinoma, 
adenocarcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma. The diagnosis requires a thoroughly sampled resected tumor with IHC stains that exclude 
adenocarcinoma (thyroid transcription factor-1 [TTF-1], napsin A) and squamous cell (p40, p63) carcinoma. This diagnosis cannot be made 
on non-resection or cytology specimens.
Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a general term that includes pleomorphic carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma. For this reason, 
it is best to use the specific term for these entities whenever possible rather than the general term. 
 ◊Pleomorphic carcinoma is a poorly differentiated NSCC that contains at least 10% spindle and/or giant cells or a carcinoma consisting 
only of spindle and giant cells. Spindle cell carcinoma consists of an almost pure population of epithelial spindle cells, while Giant cell 
carcinoma consists almost entirely of tumor giant cells.
 ◊Carcinosarcoma is a malignant tumor that consists of a mixture of NSCC and sarcoma-containing heterologous elements (eg, 
rhabdomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma).
 ◊Pulmonary blastoma is a biphasic tumor that consists of fetal adenocarcinoma (typically low grade) and primitive mesenchymal stroma.

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW

Immunohistochemistry
• Judicious use of IHC is strongly recommended to preserve tissue for biomarker testing, most notably in small specimens. When 
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinomas are poorly differentiated, the defining morphologic criteria that would allow for specific 
diagnosis may be inconspicuous or absent. In this case, IHC or mucin staining may be necessary to determine a specific diagnosis.
• In small specimens, a limited number of immunostains with one lung adenocarcinoma marker (TTF-1, napsin A) and one squamous 
carcinoma marker (p40, p63) should suffice for most diagnostic problems. Virtually all tumors that lack squamous cell morphology and show 
co-expression of p63 and TTF-1 are preferably classified as adenocarcinoma. A simple panel of TTF-1 and p40 may be sufficient to classify 
most NSCC-NOS cases. 
• 	Testing for nuclear protein in testis (NUT) expression by IHC should be considered in all poorly differentiated carcinomas that lack glandular 
differentiation or specific etiology, particularly in patients who do not smoke or in patients presenting at a young age, for consideration of a 
pulmonary NUT carcinoma. 
• IHC should be used to differentiate primary lung adenocarcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, metastatic 
carcinoma, and primary pleural mesothelioma (particularly for pleural specimens).
• Primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma:
In patients for whom the primary origin of the carcinoma is uncertain, an appropriate panel of IHC stains is recommended to assess for 
metastatic carcinoma to the lung.
TTF-1 is a homeodomain-containing nuclear transcription protein of the NKX2 gene family that is expressed in epithelial cells of the 
embryonal and mature lung and thyroid. TTF-1 immunoreactivity is seen in primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma in the majority (70%–
90%) of non-mucinous adenocarcinoma subtypes. Metastatic adenocarcinoma to the lung is nearly always negative for TTF-1 except in 
metastatic thyroid malignancies, in which case thyroglobulin and PAX8 are also positive. Rare cases of TTF-1 positivity in tumors of other 
organs (gynecologic tract, pancreatobiliary) have been noted, and may be dependent on the specific TTF-1 clone utilized, stressing the 
importance of correlation with clinical and radiologic features.
Napsin A—an aspartic proteinase expressed in normal type II pneumocytes and in proximal and distal renal tubules—appears to be 
expressed in >80% of lung adenocarcinomas and may be a useful adjunct to TTF-1.
The panel of TTF-1 (or alternatively napsin A) and p40 (or alternatively p63) may be useful in refining the diagnosis to either 
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma in small biopsy specimens previously classified as NSCC-NOS.

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW

Immunohistochemistry
• IHC should be used to confirm neuroendocrine differentiation when there is morphologic evidence of neuroendocrine morphology (eg, 
speckled chromatin pattern, nuclear molding, peripheral palisading):
NCAM (CD56), chromogranin, synaptophysin, and INSM1 are used to identify neuroendocrine tumors in cases in which morphologic 
suspicion of neuroendocrine differentiation exists. 
A panel of markers is useful, but one positive marker is enough if the staining is unambiguous in >10% of the tumor cells. 
• Pleural mesothelioma versus pulmonary adenocarcinoma
The distinction between pulmonary adenocarcinoma and pleural mesothelioma (epithelioid type) can be made by correlation of the 
histology with the clinical impression, imaging studies, and a panel of immunomarkers.
Immunostains sensitive and specific for pleural mesothelioma include WT-1, calretinin, CK5/6, and D2-40 (usually negative in 
adenocarcinoma).   
Immunostains sensitive and specific for adenocarcinoma include pCEA, Claudin-4, TTF-1, and napsin A (negative in pleural mesothelioma). 
Other potentially useful markers that can be considered include B72.3, Ber-EP4, MOC-31, and CD15, but these generally do not have the 
sensitivity and specificity of the above markers. 
A pancytokeratin such as AE1/AE3 is also useful, as a negative result suggests the possibility of other tumors.
Other markers can be helpful in the differential diagnosis between pleural mesothelioma and metastatic carcinoma, and will also help 
determine the tumor origin. Examples include markers for lung adenocarcinoma (TTF-1 and napsin A), breast carcinoma (ERα, PR, 
GCDFP-15, mammaglobin, and GATA-3), renal cell carcinoma (PAX8), serous carcinoma (PAX8, PAX2, and ER), adenocarcinomas of the 
gastrointestinal tract (CDX2), and prostate cancer (NKX3.1). Additionally, p40 (or p63) is helpful for distinguishing epithelioid pleural 
mesotheliomas with pseudosquamous morphology from squamous cell carcinomas.

The Role of Surgery in Patients with N2 NSCLC 
(NSCL-B 3 of 6 through NSCL-B 5 of 6)
Evaluation
• Determination of resectability, surgical staging, and pulmonary resection should be performed by thoracic surgeons who perform lung 
cancer surgery as a prominent part of their practice. 
• CT and FDG-PET/CT used for staging should be within 60 days before proceeding with surgical evaluation.
• For medically operable disease, resection is the preferred local treatment modality (other modalities include SABR, thermal ablation such 
as radiofrequency ablation, and cryotherapy). Thoracic surgical oncology consultation should be part of the evaluation of any patient 
being considered for curative local therapy. In cases where SABR is considered for patients at high risk or who are borderline operable, a 
multidisciplinary evaluation including a radiation oncologist is recommended.
• The overall plan of treatment as well as needed imaging studies should be determined before any non-emergency treatment is initiated.
• Thoracic surgeons should actively participate in multidisciplinary discussions and meetings regarding patients with lung cancer (eg, 
multidisciplinary clinic and/or tumor board).
• Patients who actively smoke should be provided counseling and smoking cessation support (NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation). 
While patients who actively smoke have a mildly increased incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications, these should not be 
considered a prohibitive risk for surgery. Surgeons should not deny surgery to patients solely due to smoking status, as surgery provides 
the predominant therapy for patients with early-stage lung cancer.
Resection (NSCL-B 2 of 6)
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 70 ===
PRINCIPLES OF SURGICAL THERAPY
Resection
• Anatomic pulmonary resection is preferred for the majority of patients with NSCLC.
• Sublobar resection - Segmentectomy and wedge resection should be strongly considered for peripheral T1ab, N0 tumors.1,2 
• Sublobar resection should achieve parenchymal resection margins ≥2 cm or ≥ the size of the nodule.
• Sublobar resection should also sample appropriate N1 and N2 lymph node stations unless not technically feasible without substantially 
increasing the surgical risk. 
• Segmentectomy (preferred) or wedge resection is appropriate in selected patients with poor pulmonary reserve or other major comorbidity 
that contraindicates lobectomy.
• Minimally invasive surgery (VATS or robotic-assisted approaches) should be strongly considered for patients with no anatomic or surgical 
contraindications, as long as there is no compromise of standard oncologic and dissection principles of thoracic surgery and surgeons have 
obtained and maintained proficiency in those techniques. 
• In high-volume centers with significant VATS experience, VATS lobectomy in selected patients results in improved early outcomes (ie, 
decreased pain, reduced hospital length of stay, more rapid return to function, fewer complications) without compromise of cancer 
outcomes.3
• Lung-sparing anatomic resection (sleeve lobectomy) is preferred over pneumonectomy, if anatomically appropriate and margin-negative 
resection is achieved.
• T3 (invasion) and T4 local invasion tumors require en-bloc resection of the involved structure with negative margins. If a surgeon or center is 
uncertain about potential complete resection, consider obtaining an additional surgical opinion from a high-volume specialized center.

PRINCIPLES OF SURGICAL THERAPY
Margins and Nodal Assessment
• Surgical pathologic correlation is critical to assess apparent close or positive margins, as these may not represent true margins or may not 
truly represent areas of risk for local recurrence (eg, medial surface of mainstem or bronchus intermedius when separate subcarinal lymph 
node dissection has been performed; pleural margin adjacent to aorta when no attachment to aorta is present).
• N1 and N2 node resection and mapping should be a routine component of lung cancer resections—a minimum of one N1 and three 
N2 stations sampled or complete lymph node dissection. Preoperative sampling with EBUS or mediastinoscopy should be part of N2 
assessment to achieve 3 N2 nodal stations.
• Formal ipsilateral lymph node dissection is indicated for patients undergoing resection for N2 disease.
• Complete resection requires free resection margins, systematic node dissection or sampling, and the highest mediastinal node negative 
for tumor. The resection is defined as incomplete whenever there is involvement of resection margins, unremoved positive lymph nodes, or 
positive pleural or pericardial effusions. A complete resection with negative margins is referred to as R0, microscopic positive margins as 
R1, and gross unresected tumor remaining as R2.
• Patients with clinical stage IB or greater, or high-risk factors, should be referred to medical oncology for evaluation.
• Consider referral to a radiation oncologist for N2 disease. 
The Role of Surgery in Patients with N2 NSCLC
The role of surgery in patients with pathologically documented N2 disease remains controversial.4 Two randomized trials evaluated the role of 
surgery in this population, but neither showed an overall survival benefit with the use of surgery.5,6 However, this population is heterogeneous 
and the Panel believes that these trials did not sufficiently evaluate the nuances present with the heterogeneity of N2 disease and the likely 
oncologic benefit of surgery in specific clinical situations.
• The presence or absence of N2 disease should be vigorously determined by both radiologic and invasive staging prior to the initiation of 
therapy since the presence of mediastinal nodal disease has a profound impact on prognosis and treatment decisions. (NSCL-1, NSCL-2, 
NSCL-3, NSCL-5, NSCL-8, NSCL-11, NSCL-13, and NSCL-14)
• Patients with occult-positive N2 nodes discovered at the time of pulmonary resection should continue with the planned resection along with 
formal lymph node dissection. If N2 disease is noted in patients undergoing VATS or robotic surgery, the surgeon may consider stopping the 
procedure so that induction therapy can be administered before surgery; however, continuing the procedure is also an option.
• The determination of the role of surgery in a patient with N2-positive lymph nodes should be made prior to the initiation of any therapy by a 
multidisciplinary team, including a thoracic surgeon and radiation oncologist who have a major part of their practice dedicated to thoracic 
oncology.7
• There should be a high probability of complete resection before initiation of a neoadjuvant approach. Neoadjuvant therapy to induce 
resectability is an unproven approach.
• The presence of N2-positive lymph nodes substantially increases the likelihood of positive N3 lymph nodes. Pathologic evaluation of the 
mediastinum must include evaluation of the subcarinal station and contralateral lymph nodes. EBUS ± EUS are additional techniques for 
minimally invasive pathologic staging that are complementary to mediastinoscopy. Even when these modalities are employed it is important 
to have an adequate evaluation of the number of stations involved and biopsy and documentation of negative contralateral lymph node 
involvement prior to a final treatment decision.

PRINCIPLES OF SURGICAL THERAPY
The Role of Surgery in Patients with N2 NSCLC
• Repeat mediastinoscopy, while possible, is technically difficult and has a lower accuracy compared to primary mediastinoscopy. One 
possible strategy is to perform EBUS (± EUS) in the initial pretreatment evaluation and reserve mediastinoscopy for nodal restaging after 
neoadjuvant therapy.
• Patients with a single lymph node <3 cm can be considered for a multimodality approach that includes surgical resection.4,9,10
• Restaging after induction therapy is difficult to interpret, but CT ± FDG-PET/CT should be performed to exclude disease progression or 
interval development of metastatic disease.
• Patients with negative mediastinum after neoadjuvant therapy have a better prognosis.10,11
• Data from a large multi-institutional trial indicate that pneumonectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has unacceptable morbidity 
and mortality.5 However, it is not clear if this is also true with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. Further, many groups have challenged 
that cooperative group finding with single-institution experiences demonstrating safety of pneumonectomy after induction therapy.12-15 In 
addition, there is no evidence that adding RT to induction regimens for patients with operable stage IIIA (N2) disease improves outcomes 
compared to induction chemotherapy.

The Role of Surgery in Patients with N2 NSCLC
A questionnaire was submitted to the NCCN Member Institutions in 2024 regarding their approach to patients with N2 disease. Their 
responses indicate the patterns of practice when approaching this difficult clinical problem. 
• All NCCN Member Institutions treat select N2 patients with multimodality therapy that includes surgery.
• All NCCN Member Institutions consider surgery for single-station non-bulky N2 disease.
100% consider surgery after neoadjuvant therapy
33% consider upfront surgery for single-station non-bulky N2 disease
None consider upfront surgery for multi-station or bulky (≥3 cm) N2 disease
• After neoadjuvant therapy, 100% consider surgery for single-station non-bulky N2 disease
76% consider surgery for single-station bulky (≥3 cm) disease
67% consider surgery for multi-station non-bulky disease 
27% consider surgery for multi-station bulky (≥3 cm) disease
• All NCCN Member Institutions prefer neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± immunotherapy most of the time. 
None use chemoradiotherapy most of the time.
• 85% require at least stable disease on imaging after induction neoadjuvant therapy for consideration of surgery.
None require imaging complete response in mediastinal lymph nodes.
94% do not require pathologic complete response in mediastinal lymph nodes.
82% do not use pathologic evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes to make a final decision regarding surgery.
• 76% would consider pneumonectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
• 54% would consider adjuvant RT for positive residual N2 disease, but only 9% would consider RT for N2 pathologic complete response.
• For a resected stage III tumor, adjuvant immunotherapy is given at 30% of Member Institutions and considered at 24% of Member Institutions 
if PD-L1 negative.
Given at 81% and considered at 13% if PD-L1 ≥1%–49%
Given at 91% and considered at 9% if PD-L1 ≥50%
• If neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy is given and there is a pathologic complete response, adjuvant therapy is recommended at about a 
quarter of Member Institutions (24%) and considered at 27% of Member Institutions.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
I. General Principles
• Determination of the appropriateness of RT should be made by radiation oncologists who perform lung cancer RT as a prominent part of 
their practice. 
• RT has a potential role in all stages of NSCLC, as either definitive/consolidative or palliative therapy. Radiation oncology input as part of 
a multidisciplinary evaluation or discussion should be provided for all patients with stage III NSCLC, with early-stage disease who are 
medically inoperable, who refuse surgery, or who are high-risk surgical candidates, and with stage IV disease that may benefit from local 
therapy.
• The critical goals of modern RT are to maximize tumor control and to minimize treatment toxicity. A minimum technologic standard is CT-
planned three-dimensional-conformal RT (3D-CRT).1
• More advanced technologies are appropriate when needed to deliver curative RT safely. These technologies include (but are not limited to)  
four-dimensional (4D)-CT, FDG-PET/CT and/or MRI simulation, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), 
image-guided RT (IGRT), motion management, and proton therapy (https://www.astro.org/Daily-Practice/Reimbursement/Model-Policies/
Model-Policies). Nonrandomized comparisons of using advanced technologies demonstrate reduced toxicity and improved survival versus 
older techniques.2-4 In a prospective trial of definitive/consolidative chemotherapy/RT for patients with stage III NSCLC (RTOG 0617), IMRT 
was associated with a nearly 60% decrease (from 7.9% to 3.5%) in high-grade radiation pneumonitis as well as similar survival and tumor 
control outcomes despite a higher proportion of stage IIIB and larger treatment volumes compared to 3D-CRT;5 as such, IMRT is preferred 
over 3D-CRT in this setting. In retrospective studies, intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) has also been shown to reduce the toxicities 
as compared with 3D-based passive scattering proton therapy in stage III NSCLC.3
• Highly conformal RT, such as IMRT or proton therapy, should be used in the setting of prior RT, potentially with hyperfractionation, to reduce 
risk of toxicity.
• Centers using advanced technologies should implement and document modality-specific quality assurance measures. The ideal is external 
credentialing of both treatment planning and delivery such as required for participation in RTOG clinical trials employing advanced 
technologies. Useful references include the ACR Practice Parameters and Technical Standards.
• The interaction of strong vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors with prior or subsequent dose-intensive RT (SABR or definitive 
dose accelerated fractionation) involving the proximal bronchial tree, hilar vessels, or esophagus can lead to serious toxicity. Careful 
coordination of medical and radiation oncology on the therapeutic strategy is important, including the choice and sequencing of systemic 
agents with strong VEGF inhibitors and the dose and fractionation of radiation, especially for patients with metastatic disease.
II. Radiation Therapy Simulation, Planning, and Delivery
• Simulation should be performed using CT scans obtained in the RT treatment position with appropriate immobilization devices. IV contrast 
with or without oral contrast is recommended for better target/organ delineation whenever possible in patients with central tumors or nodal 
disease. Because IV contrast can affect tissue heterogeneity correction calculations, density masking or use of a pre-contrast scan may be 
needed when intense enhancement is present.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
II. Radiation Therapy Simulation, Planning, and Delivery (continued)
• FDG-PET/CT significantly improves targeting accuracy,6 especially for patients with significant atelectasis and when IV CT contrast is 
contraindicated. A randomized trial of FDG-PET/CT versus CT-only RT planning demonstrated improved preemption of futile radical 
RT, decreased recurrences, and a trend toward improved overall survival with FDG-PET/CT RT planning.7 Given the potential for rapid 
progression of NSCLC,8,9 FDG-PET/CT should be obtained preferably within 4 weeks before treatment. It is ideal to obtain FDG-PET/CT in the 
treatment position.
• Tumor and organ motion, especially owing to breathing, should be assessed or accounted for at simulation. Options include fluoroscopy, 
inhale/exhale or slow scan CT, or, ideally, 4D-CT. 
• Photon beam energy should be individualized based on the anatomic location of the tumors and beam paths. In general, photon energies 
between 4 to 10 MV are recommended for beams passing through low-density lung tissue before entering the tumor. When there is no air 
gap before the beam enters the tumor (such as for some large mediastinal tumors or tumors attached to the chest wall), higher energies may 
improve the dose distribution, especially when using a smaller number of fixed beam angles.
• Tissue heterogeneity correction and accurate dose calculation algorithms are recommended that account for buildup and lateral electron 
scatter effects in heterogeneously dense tissues. Heterogeneity correction with simple pencil beam algorithms is not recommended.10
• Respiratory motion should be managed when motion is excessive. This includes (but is not limited to) forced shallow breathing with 
abdominal compression, accelerator beam gating with the respiratory cycle, dynamic tumor tracking, active breathing control (ABC), or 
coaching/biofeedback techniques. If motion is minimal or the ITV is small, motion-encompassing targeting is appropriate. A useful resource 
for implementation of respiratory motion management is the report of AAPM Task Group 76.11
• IGRT—including (but not limited to) orthogonal pair planar imaging and/or volumetric imaging (such as cone-beam CT [CBCT], CT on rails, 
or MRI)—is recommended when using SABR, 3D-CRT/IMRT, and proton therapy with steep dose gradients around the target, when organs at 
risk (OARs) are in close proximity to high-dose regions, and when using complex motion management techniques.
III. Target Volumes, Prescription Doses, and Normal Tissue Dose Constraints (See Tables 1–4 on NSCL-C 7 of 12 and NSCL-C 8 of 12)
• ICRU Reports 62 and 83 detail the current definitions of target volumes for 3D-CRT and IMRT. Gross tumor volume (GTV) comprises the 
known extent of disease (primary and nodal) on imaging and pathologic assessment, clinical target volume (CTV) includes regions of 
presumed microscopic extent or dissemination, and planning target volume (PTV) comprises the internal target volume (ITV; which includes 
margin for target motion) plus a setup margin for positioning and mechanical variability (https://www.nrgoncology.org/ciro-lung).
• PTV margin can be decreased by immobilization, motion management, and IGRT techniques.
• Consistent delineation of normal structures is critical for evaluating plans for safety. The RTOG consensus lung-contouring atlas is a useful 
resource (https://www.nrgoncology.org/ciro-lung).
• Commonly used prescription doses and normal tissue dose constraints are summarized in Tables 1 through 4. These are based on 
published experience, ongoing trials, historical data, modeling, and empirical judgment.12,13 Useful references include the recent reviews of 
normal organ dose responses from the QUANTEC project.14-18 Because risk of normal organ toxicity increases with dose, doses to normal 
organs should be kept as low as reasonably achievable rather than simply meeting nominal constraints. This is generally facilitated by more 
advanced techniques to achieve better dose conformity.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
IV. General Treatment Information 
Early-Stage NSCLC (stage I, selected node-negative stage IIA)
• SABR (also known as stereotactic body RT [SBRT])19 has achieved good primary tumor control rates and overall survival, as well as 
higher than conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Although SABR is not proven equivalent to lobectomy, some prospective series have 
demonstrated similar overall and cancer-specific survival with reduced acute toxicity.20-31 
• SABR is also an appropriate option for patients with high surgical risk (able to tolerate sublobar resection but not lobectomy [eg, age ≥75 
years, poor lung or cardiac function]). 
• More modestly hypofractionated or dose-intensified conventionally fractionated highly conformal radiation (IMRT with IGRT preferred) are 
less preferred alternatives and may be considered if referral for SABR is not feasible.32-34
• In patients treated with surgery, postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) is not recommended unless there are positive margins (see Locally 
Advanced NSCLC in this section for patients upstaged to N2).
• Close follow-up and therapy for isolated local and/or locoregional recurrence after SABR have been shown to improve overall survival in a 
large retrospective study.35
SABR for Node-Negative Early-Stage NSCLC
• The high-dose intensity and conformity of SABR require minimizing the PTV.
• Dosing regimen
For SABR, intensive regimens of biologically effective dose (BED) ≥100 Gy are associated with significantly better local control and survival 
than less intensive regimens.36,37 In the United States, only regimens of ≤5 fractions meet the arbitrary billing code definition of SBRT, but 
slightly more protracted regimens are appropriate as well.36,38 For centrally located tumors (defined variably as within 2 cm of the proximal 
bronchial tree and/or abutting mediastinal pleura) and even ultra-central tumors (defined as abutting the proximal bronchial tree or, in some 
definitions, other critical mediastinal structures as well), 4 to 10 fraction risk-adapted SABR regimens appear to be effective and safe,39-
42 while 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions is unsafe and should be avoided.43 However, particular attention should be paid to tumors abutting the 
bronchial tree and esophagus to avoid severe toxicity. RTOG 0813 evaluated the toxicity of 5-fraction regimens and found no high-grade 
toxicities at 50 Gy in 5 fractions.44
• SABR is most commonly used for tumors up to 5 cm in size, though selected larger isolated tumors can be treated safely if normal tissue 
constraints are respected.44,45  
• Retrospective data suggest that chemotherapy in addition to SABR provides a survival advantage for patients with large tumors (≥5 cm).46 
Adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered for large tumors in selected patients for whom it is safe. 
• Prescription doses incompletely describe the actual delivered doses, which also strongly depend on how the dose is prescribed (to the 
isocenter vs. an isodose volume covering a proportion of the PTV), the degree of dose heterogeneity, whether tissue density heterogeneity 
corrections are used, and the type of dose calculation algorithm.10,47,48 All of these must be considered when interpreting or emulating 
regimens from prior studies.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 78 ===
PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
Locally Advanced NSCLC (stage II–III)
• Concurrent chemotherapy/RT is recommended for patients with inoperable stage II (node-positive) and stage III NSCLC.
• RT interruptions and dose reductions for manageable acute toxicities should be avoided by employing supportive care. 
• Sequential chemotherapy/RT or RT alone is appropriate for patients who are frail and unable to tolerate concurrent therapy.53,54  
Accelerated RT regimens may be beneficial, particularly if concurrent chemotherapy would not be tolerated (ie, in a sequential or RT-only 
approach).
• Preoperative systemic therapy and PORT is an option for patients with resectable N2 NSCLC (minimal N2 and treatable with lobectomy).57,58
• Preoperative concurrent chemotherapy/RT is an alternative option for patients with resectable N2 NSCLC and is recommended for resectable 
superior sulcus tumors. RT should be planned up front such that it continues to a definitive dose without interruption if the patient does 
not proceed to surgery as initially planned. 
• The optimal timing of RT in trimodality therapy (preoperative with chemotherapy or postoperative) is not established and is 
controversial.
• The determination of resectability in trimodality therapy should be made prior to initiation of all treatment. Upfront multidisciplinary 
consultation is particularly important when considering surgical treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC.
• In patients with clinical stage I/II upstaged surgically to N2 with completely resected disease, two randomized studies did not show an 
overall survival benefit of PORT, although locoregional control was significantly improved.63,64 PORT (generally following postoperative 
chemotherapy) may be considered for selected patients with high-risk N2 disease, such as extracapsular extension, multi-station 
involvement, inadequate lymph node dissection/sampling, and/or refusal or intolerance of adjuvant systemic therapy. To minimize potential 
lung and heart toxicities, highly conformal RT techniques such as IMRT or proton therapy are preferred.65-68
• In patients with completely resected pN1 receiving adjuvant systemic therapy, PORT is not recommended. PORT may be considered for 
these patients if they are unable to receive adjuvant systemic therapy.62
Conventionally Fractionated RT for Locally Advanced NSCLC
• Involved field irradiation (IFI) omitting elective nodal irradiation (ENI) allows tumor dose escalation and is associated with a low risk of 
isolated nodal relapse, particularly in a patient staged with FDG-PET/CT.69-73 Three randomized trials found improved survival for IFI versus 
ENI, possibly because it enabled dose escalation. IFI is reasonable in order to optimize definitive dosing to the tumor and/or decrease 
normal tissue toxicity.
• Dosing Regimens
The most commonly prescribed doses for definitive RT are 60 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Doses of at least 60 Gy should be given.77 Dose 
escalation is associated with better survival in non-randomized comparisons in RT alone,78 sequential chemotherapy/RT,79 or concurrent 
chemotherapy/RT. While optimal RT dose intensification remains a valid question, a high dose of 74 Gy is not currently recommended for 
routine use.
A meta-analysis demonstrated improved survival with accelerated fractionation RT regimens,87 and RTOG 1106 found that PET-based 
individualized accelerated RT dose intensification potentially improved local control but not overall survival.

Doses of 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions are standard preoperative doses.89 Definitive RT doses delivered as preoperative 
chemotherapy/RT can safely be administered and achieve promising nodal clearance and survival rates,90-93 but require experience in 
thoracic surgical techniques to minimize the risk of surgical complications after high-dose RT. 
In PORT, the CTV includes the bronchial stump and high-risk draining lymph node stations.94 Standard doses after complete resection are 
50 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions, but a boost may be administered to high-risk regions including areas of nodal extracapsular extension 
or microscopic positive margins.95-97 Lung dose constraints should be more conservative, because tolerance appears to be reduced after 
surgery. The LungART and PORT-C trials provide useful guidelines for PORT technique.98 Highly conformal techniques to minimize lung 
and heart dose are preferred. 
Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC (stage IV)
• RT is recommended for local palliation or prevention of symptoms (such as pain, bleeding, or obstruction).
• Oligometastasis: Definitive/consolidative local therapy to isolated or limited metastatic sites (oligometastases) (including but not limited 
to brain, lung, and adrenal gland) achieves prolonged survival in a small proportion of well-selected patients with good performance 
status (PS) who have also received radical therapy to the intrathoracic disease.99 Definitive RT to oligometastases (limited number is not 
universally defined but clinical trials have included 3–5 metastases), particularly SABR, is an appropriate option in such cases if it can be 
delivered safely to the involved sites.100,101
In two randomized phase II trials of predominantly synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC (metastases present at the time of diagnosis and 
initial treatment), significantly improved progression-free survival (and overall survival in one trial)102,103 was found for local consolidative 
therapy (RT or surgery) to oligometastatic lesions versus maintenance systemic therapy or observation for patients whose disease was not 
progressing on systemic therapy (predominantly chemotherapy without immunotherapy).102-104
The role of local consolidative therapy for synchronous oligometastatic disease initially treated with systemic therapy predominantly 
including immunotherapy is currently unclear. Preliminary results of NRG-LU002 did not demonstrate a progression-free survival 
advantage in this setting.105
Three randomized trials (two phase III and one phase II) for synchronous oligometastatic or oligo-organ EGFR-mutated NSCLC tested 
initial/early incorporation of dose-intensive radiotherapy with first-generation EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) vs. EGFR-TKI 
alone demonstrated significant overall survival advantage of radiotherapy.106-108 This approach is currently being evaluated in the setting 
of newer generation EGFR-TKIs.
In the setting of metachronous oligometastasis (metastases presenting after definitive treatment of earlier stage disease), the SABR-
COMET randomized phase II trial, which included patients with oligometastatic NSCLC, demonstrated an overall survival benefit of SABR to 
oligometastases compared to palliative standard of care.109

Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC (stage IV) (continued)
• In the setting of progression at a limited number of sites on a given line of systemic therapy (oligoprogression), local ablative therapy to the 
oligoprogressive sites may extend the duration of benefit of the current line of systemic therapy.
• 	When treating oligometastatic/oligoprogressive lesions, if SABR is not feasible, other dose-intensive accelerated/hypofractionated CRT 
regimens may be used.
• See the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers regarding RT for brain metastases.
• A pooled analysis of two randomized trials indicated that adding RT to a certain ICI (anti-PD-1) significantly increased responses and clinical 
outcomes in patients with metastatic NSCLC.110 Larger phase III randomized studies are ongoing.
Palliative RT for Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC
• The dose and fractionation of palliative RT should be individualized based on goals of care, symptoms, PS, and logistical considerations. 
Shorter courses of RT are preferred for patients with poor PS and/or shorter life expectancy because they provide similar pain relief as 
longer courses, although there is a higher potential need for retreatment.111-114 For palliation of thoracic symptoms, higher dose/longer-
course thoracic RT (eg, ≥30 Gy in 10 fractions) is associated with modestly improved survival and symptoms, particularly in patients with 
good PS.115,116 When higher doses (>30 Gy) are warranted, technologies to reduce normal tissue irradiation (at least 3D-CRT and including 
IMRT or proton therapy as appropriate) may be used. 
• Single-fraction stereotactic RT (SRT) of 12–16 Gy produced better control of pain response and local control of non-spine bone metastases 
compared to standard 30 Gy in 10 fractions in a randomized phase II trial, and may be promising for patients with longer expected 
survival.117 SABR/SRS has been found in randomized clinical trials to produce better pain and tumor control of spine and non-spine bone 
metastases than conventionally fractionated palliative RT, and is appropriate especially for patients with longer expected survival.118

PRINCIPLES OF IMAGE-GUIDED THERMAL ABLATION THERAPY
General Principles
• 	Interventional radiologists should actively participate in multidisciplinary discussions and meetings regarding patients with NSCLC (eg, multidisciplinary 
clinic and/or tumor board).
• 	Decisions about whether ablation is feasible should be performed by interventional radiologists who perform IGTA as a prominent part of their practice.  
• 	IGTA includes radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation. IGTA is a form of “local therapy” or “local ablative therapy.”1  
• 	IGTA is a lung parenchymal sparing technique with at most a temporary decrement in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and diffusing 
capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which is statistically indistinguishable from baseline after recovery.2-6
Evaluation
• 	IGTA may be considered for those patients who are deemed “high risk”—those with tumors that are for the most part surgically resectable but rendered 
medically inoperable due to comorbidities. In cases where IGTA is considered for patients who are high risk or borderline operable, a multidisciplinary 
evaluation is recommended.
• 	IGTA has been successfully accomplished in patients considered “high risk,” objectively defined with a single major and/or two or more minor criteria.  
Major criteria included an FEV1 or DCLO ≤50%, and minor criteria included a less depressed FEV1 or DLCO between 51%–60%, age ≥75 years, pulmonary 
hypertension, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%, resting or exercise PaO2 <55 mmHg, and pCO2 >45 mmHg.4
• 	If an interventional radiologist or center is uncertain about the feasibility or safety of IGTA or the use of IGTA for radiation failure, consider obtaining an 
additional interventional radiology opinion from a high-volume specialized center.
Ablation
• 	Each energy modality has advantages and disadvantages. Determination of energy modality to be used for ablation should take into consideration the size 
and location of the target tumor, risk of complication, as well as local expertise and/or operator familiarity.7
Ablation for NSCLC
• 	IGTA is an option for the management of NSCLC lesions <3 cm. Ablation for NSCLC lesions >3 cm may be associated with higher rates of local recurrence 
and complications.8,9
• 	There is evidence on the use of IGTA for selected patients with stage IA NSCLC, those who present with multiple lung cancers, or those who present with 
locoregional recurrence of symptomatic local thoracic disease.
• Like surgery, pneumothorax may occur after IGTA, particularly if multiple lesions are treated in a single session. Pneumothorax has been reported in 
18.7%–45.7% of IGTA cases. Self-limited pneumothorax, not requiring chest tube placement, is an expected event and not considered a complication 
unless escalation of care is required. In 20.7% of IGTA cases, chest tube insertion may be required.10

PRINCIPLES OF PERIOPERATIVE SYSTEMIC THERAPY
General Principles
• Patients with stages IB–IIIA, IIIB (T2–T3, N2b; T4, N2) disease should be evaluated for neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant systemic therapy based 
on biomarker testing (PD-L1 status, EGFR mutations, and ALK gene fusions) and other clinical and molecular factors.  
Principles of Biomarker Analysis (NSCL-H).
• For Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy options if tumor is deemed resectable after surgical evaluation, refer to:
 Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy in Patients Who Are Candidates for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
 ◊Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) + chemotherapy should be strongly considered if patient is eligible 
Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy for Patients Who Are Not Candidates for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
• For Adjuvant Systemic Therapy options, refer to:
Adjuvant Chemotherapy
Other Adjuvant Systemic Therapy
• In general, perioperative ICI therapy should be given as a single regimen and change of ICI agent is not recommended. 
• Contraindications for treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may include active or previously documented autoimmune disease and/or current 
use of immunosuppressive agents; some oncogenic drivers (ie, EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation; ALK, RET, or ROS1 gene fusions) 
have been shown to be associated with less benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. 
• Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV atezolizumab. Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs 
has different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV atezolizumab. 
• Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV nivolumab. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy has 
different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV nivolumab. 
• Pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab and 
berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph has different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV pembrolizumab.

PRINCIPLES OF BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
Molecular Diagnostic Studies in NSCLC
• Numerous gene alterations have been identified that impact therapy selection. Testing of lung cancer specimens for these alterations is 
important for identification of potentially efficacious targeted therapies, as well as avoidance of therapies unlikely to provide clinical benefit.  
• Some selection approaches for targeted therapy include predictive IHC analyses, which are distinct from IHC studies utilized to identify 
tumor type and lineage.
• Clinicopathologic features should not be used to select patients for testing. 
• Major elements of biomarker testing that are critical for utilization and interpretation of molecular results include:
Use of a laboratory that is properly accredited, with a minimum of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) accreditation
Understanding the methodologies that are utilized and the major limitations of those methodologies 
Understanding the spectrum of alterations tested (and those not tested) by a specific assay
Knowledge of whether a tumor sample is subjected to pathologic review and tumor enrichment (ie, microdissection, macrodissection) prior 
to testing
The types of samples accepted by the testing laboratory
Understanding what constitutes an informative versus a null result. A positive finding for a known oncogenic driver is considered an 
informative result. Absence of a known oncogenic driver, including results that show only "passenger" alterations, might be considered 
null depending on the context of the specimen limitations and clinical situation. Specifically, technical issues related to tumor cellularity 
in tissue testing or burden of disease in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing are considerations in interpretation of findings. Additional 
considerations are elaborated in sections below.
• Tissue Specimen Acquisition and Management:
Although tumor testing has been primarily focused on use of FFPE tissues, increasingly, laboratories accept other specimen types, notably 
cytopathology preparations not processed by FFPE methods. Although testing on cell blocks is not included in the FDA approval for 
multiple companion diagnostic assays, testing on these specimen types is highly recommended when it is the only or best material. 
A major limitation in obtaining tissue biomarker testing results for NSCLC occurs when minimally invasive techniques are used to obtain 
samples; the yield may be insufficient for molecular, biomarker, and histologic testing. Therefore, bronchoscopists and interventional 
radiologists should procure sufficient tissue to enable all appropriate testing.
When tissue is minimal, laboratories should deploy techniques to maximize tissue for biomarker testing, including dedicated histology 
protocols for small biopsies, including “up-front” slide sectioning for diagnostic and predictive testing. Peripheral blood (plasma ctDNA) 
can be a surrogate sample (NSCL-H 8 of 8).
• Testing Methodologies
Appropriate possible testing methodologies are indicated below for each analyte separately; however, several methodologies are generally 
considerations for use:
 ◊Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is used in clinical laboratories. Not all types of alterations are detected by individual NGS assays and 
it is important to be familiar with the types of alterations identifiable in individual assays or combination(s) of assays.
	
– MGPT approaches that efficiently utilize limited biopsy tissue while maximizing diagnostic genomic information are most commonly 
NGS-based. NCCN acknowledges that many currently available NGS-based assays used to fully genotype NSCLC are larger than the 
50-gene limit threshold utilized by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) coding convention; as a result, utilization of panels >50 
genes may be practical to follow these recommendations. Either a single assay or a combination of a limited number of assays may be 
appropriate.
	
– Although MGPT approaches are preferred, in some clinical situations rapid testing may be warranted and should be followed up with 
MGPT.

PRINCIPLES OF BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
• Testing Methodologies (continued)
 ◊RNA-based NGS may increase novel fusion detection and can be performed concurrently or sequentially with DNA-based NGS. If no 
identifiable driver oncogenes with DNA-based broad molecular profiling are identified, RNA-based testing is recommended.
	
– Biomarker testing is considered complete if a minimum of biomarkers are identified in NSCL-20 in either a single assay or a 
combination of a limited number of assays, and optimally also identifies emerging biomarkers (NSCL-I). Sequential, single-gene testing 
is not preferred. Tiered approaches based on low prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable.
 ◊Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used in a highly targeted fashion (specific mutations targeted). When this technology 
is deployed, only those specific alterations that are targeted by the assay are assessed and the potential for mutations outside of the 
testing scope of the specific assay must be considered. 
 ◊Any method that interrogates sequences other than a subset of highly specific alterations (eg, NGS) has the potential to identify variants 
of uncertain significance (VUS). Any variant classified as a VUS, even if in a gene in which other variants are clinically actionable, should 
not be considered as a basis for targeted therapy selection.
 ◊Other methodologies may be utilized, including multiplex approaches not listed above.
 ◊Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis is utilized for many assays examining copy number, amplification, and structural 
alterations such as gene rearrangements. FISH may have better sensitivity for gene amplification events in some circumstances. FISH 
testing allows one to identify a chromosomal rearrangement, from which one can infer the presence of a gene fusion event.
• Specimen Selection
Testing platforms using tissue and peripheral blood are available.
Testing using tissue sample requires acquisition of a suitable sample.
 ◊Alterations detected using NSCLC tumor tissue can be most directly attributed to the tumor.
 ◊If an assay has a technical failure related to an insufficient quantity, consideration of an alternate testing modality or procurement of 
additional tissue is recommended to achieve complete biomarker testing. 
Testing using peripheral blood (most commonly plasma-based testing of ctDNA) can be utilized in conjunction with tissue-based testing to 
achieve genotyping for recommended biomarkers.
 ◊Many, but not all, ctDNA tests use NGS-based technology. The technical advantages and limitations of ctDNA testing are further 
elaborated below.

PRINCIPLES OF BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
• Molecular Targets for Analysis
In general, the mutations/alterations described below are seen in a non-overlapping fashion, although between 1%–3% of NSCLC may 
harbor concurrent alterations.
EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) Gene Mutations: EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase normally found on the surface of epithelial 
cells and is often overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies. 
 ◊The most commonly described mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletions, p.L858R point mutation in exon 21) are associated with 
responsiveness to oral EGFR TK therapy; tumors that do not harbor a sensitizing EGFR mutation should not be treated with EGFR TKI in 
any line of therapy.
 ◊Biomarker testing for EGFR mutations should be performed when TKI therapy is a consideration for NSCLC stage IB–IIIC. While the 
testing process may be technically easier on a resection specimen, initial diagnostic biopsy specimens are also acceptable for testing 
for this indication. 
 ◊Many of the less commonly observed alterations in EGFR, which cumulatively account for ~10% of EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC (ie, 
exon 21 p.L861Q, exon 18 p.G719X, and exon 20 p.S768I mutations), are also associated with responsiveness to certain EGFR TKIs, such 
as osimertinib and afatinib, and should be considered on a mutation-specific basis, when possible.
 ◊EGFR p.T790M is most commonly observed as a mutation that arises in response to and as a mechanism of resistance to first- and 
second-generation EGFR TKI. In patients with progression on first- or second-generation TKI with p.T790M as the primary mechanism of 
resistance, third-generation TKIs are typically efficacious. 
	
– If EGFR p.T790M is identified in the absence of prior EGFR TKI therapy, genetic counseling and possible germline MGPT are warranted. 
Identification of germline EGFR p.T790M confers a high risk for lung cancer regardless of smoking status.
 ◊EGFR exon 20 (EGFRex20) mutations (other than EGFR p.T790M) are a heterogeneous group, some of which are responsive to targeted 
therapy and that require detailed knowledge of the specific alteration. 
	
– Most EGFRex20 alterations are a diverse group of in-frame duplication or insertions.  
	▪These are generally associated with lack of response to first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR TKI therapy, with select 
exceptions: p.A763_Y764insFQEA is associated with sensitivity to TKI therapy and p.A763_Y764insLQEA may be associated with 
sensitivity to first- and third-generation TKI therapy. 
	▪EGFRex20 insertions/duplications are associated with responsiveness to specific targeted subsequent therapy agents designed 
for EGFRex20 events. The most commonly represented EGFRex20 insertions/duplications in the clinical studies have been insASV, 
insSVD, and insNPH, although a wide spectrum of other alterations were included. There is currently no evidence that the specific 
alteration type impacts the probability of responsiveness to this class of targeted therapy. 
	▪Because some EGFRex20 mutations are or may be sensitive to first- and third-generation inhibitors, the specific sequence of 
EGFRex20 insertion mutations remains important. Some assays will identify the presence of an EGFRex20 insertion without 
specifying the sequence, and additional testing to further clarify the EGFRex20 insertion may be indicated for therapy selection.
	▪Targeted PCR-based approaches for detection of EGFR mutations under-detect EGFRex20 insertion events; therefore, NGS-based 
strategies are preferred.  
 ◊Testing Methodologies: Real-time PCR and NGS are the most commonly deployed methodologies for examining EGFR mutation status.

PRINCIPLES OF BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
• Molecular Targets for Analysis (continued)
ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) Gene Fusions: ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can be rearranged in NSCLC, resulting in 
dysregulation and inappropriate signaling through the ALK kinase domain.
 ◊The most common fusion partner seen with ALK is echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4), although a variety of other 
fusion partners have been identified.
 ◊Biomarker testing for ALK gene fusions should be performed when TKI therapy is a consideration for NSCLC stage IB–IIIB. While the 
testing process may be technically easier on a resection specimen, initial diagnostic biopsy specimens are also acceptable for testing 
for this indication. 
 ◊The presence of an ALK gene fusion is associated with responsiveness to oral ALK TKIs.
 ◊Testing Methodologies: FISH break-apart probe methodology was the first methodology deployed widely. IHC can be deployed as an 
effective screening strategy. FDA-approved IHC can be utilized as a stand-alone test, not requiring confirmation by FISH. Numerous NGS 
methodologies can detect ALK gene fusions. Targeted real-time PCR assays are used in some settings, although it is unlikely to detect 
fusions with novel partners.
ROS1 (ROS proto-oncogene 1) Gene Fusions: ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can be rearranged in NSCLC, resulting in 
dysregulation and inappropriate signaling through the ROS1 kinase domain.
 ◊Numerous fusion partners are seen with ROS1, and common fusion partners include: CD74, SLC34A2, CCDC6, and GOPC (FIG).
 ◊The presence of a ROS1 gene fusion is associated with responsiveness to oral ROS1 TKIs.
 ◊Testing Methodologies: FISH break-apart probe methodology can be deployed; however, it may under-detect the FIG::ROS1 variant. 
IHC approaches can be deployed; however, IHC for ROS1 fusions has low specificity, and follow-up confirmatory testing is a necessary 
component of utilizing ROS1 IHC as a screening modality. Numerous NGS methodologies can detect ROS1 gene fusions, although DNA-
based NGS may under-detect ROS1 gene fusions. Targeted real-time PCR assays are utilized in some settings, although they are unlikely 
to detect fusions with novel partners.
BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene) Point Mutations: BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the canonical MAPK pathway. Activating 
mutations in BRAF result in unregulated signaling through the MAPK pathway.
 ◊Mutations in BRAF can be seen in NSCLC. The presence of a specific mutation resulting in a change in amino acid position 600 (most 
commonly p.V600E, but rarely p.V600K, p.V600D, or other changes) has been associated with responsiveness to combined therapy with 
oral inhibitors of BRAF and MEK.
 ◊Note that other mutations in BRAF are observed in NSCLC, and the impact of those mutations on therapy selection is not well 
understood at this time.
 ◊Testing Methodologies: Real-time PCR and NGS are the most commonly deployed methodologies for examining BRAF mutation status. 
While an anti-BRAF p.V600E-specific monoclonal antibody is commercially available, and some studies have examined utilizing this 
approach, it should only be deployed after extensive validation.
NRG1 gene fusions: NRG1 is an epidermal growth factor (EGF) involved in nervous system and cardiac development and homeostasis. 
NRG1 gene fusions lead to inappropriate signaling via the ERBB family receptor tyrosine kinase pathway. 
 ◊The presence of an NRG1 gene fusion is associated with responsiveness to a HER2/HER3 bispecific antibody.
 ◊Testing Methodologies: NGS-based testing is the primary method for detection of NRG1 gene fusions; RNA-based NGS is preferable to 
DNA-based NGS as NRG1 gene fusions are often not detected by DNA-based NGS because the large introns in NRG1 are not commonly 
included in targeted DNA-based NGS panels or whole exome sequencing. IHC is not a suitable method for detection of NRG1 gene 
fusion. FISH testing requires confirmation by NGS.

PRINCIPLES OF BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
• Molecular Targets for Analysis (continued)
KRAS (KRAS proto-oncogene) point mutations: KRAS is a G-protein with intrinsic GTPase activity, and activating mutations result in 
unregulated signaling through the MAPK pathway.
 ◊Mutations in KRAS are most commonly seen at codon 12, although other mutations can be seen in NSCLC.
 ◊The presence of a KRAS mutation is prognostic of poor survival when compared to patients with tumors without KRAS mutation.
 ◊Owing to the low probability of overlapping targetable alterations, the presence of a known activating mutation in KRAS identifies 
patients who are unlikely to benefit from further molecular testing.
 ◊The presence of KRAS p.G12C is associated with responsiveness to oral KRAS G12C inhibitors used for subsequent therapy, which were 
designed specifically for this mutation. Responsiveness to this class of inhibitor has not been prospectively evaluated with mutations 
other than KRAS p.G12C.
 ◊Testing methodologies: NGS and real-time PCR are the most commonly deployed methodologies for examining KRAS mutation status. 
MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition) exon 14 (METex14) skipping variants: HGFR (MET) is a receptor tyrosine kinase. A mutation that 
results in loss of exon 14 can occur in NSCLC. Loss of METex14 leads to dysregulation and inappropriate signaling.
 ◊The presence of METex14 skipping mutation is associated with responsiveness to oral MET TKIs.
 ◊A broad range of molecular alterations lead to METex14 skipping.
 ◊Testing Methodologies: NGS-based testing is the primary method for detection of METex14 skipping events; RNA-based NGS may have 
improved detection. IHC is not a method for detection of METex14 skipping.
RET (rearranged during transfection) Gene Fusions: RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can be rearranged in NSCLC, resulting in 
dysregulation and inappropriate signaling through the RET kinase domain.
 ◊Common fusion partners are KIF5B, NCOA4, and CCDC6; however, numerous other fusion partners have been identified.
 ◊The presence of a RET gene fusion is associated with responsiveness to oral RET TKIs regardless of fusion partner.
 ◊Testing Methodologies: FISH break-apart probe methodology can be deployed; however, it may under-detect some fusions. Targeted 
real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR assays are utilized in some settings, although they are unlikely to detect fusions with novel partners. 
NGS-based methodology has a high specificity, and RNA-based NGS is preferable to DNA-based NGS for fusion detection. 
ERBB2 (Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2)/HER2 Gene Mutations: ERBB2 encodes for HER2, a receptor tyrosine kinase found on the 
surface of normal epithelial cells that is often overexpressed or mutated in a variety of human malignancies.
 ◊A spectrum of genomic alterations involving ERBB2 have been identified in multiple tumor types, including mutations and amplifications, 
and less commonly, other alterations.
 ◊Mutations in ERBB2 are most commonly insertion/duplication events in exon 20, and less commonly, other activating mutations are 
observed. 
 ◊Activating mutations in ERBB2 are associated with responsiveness to anti-HER2 targeted therapy agents.
	
– While some mutations are known to be activating, including mutations in the extracellular domain (eg, p.S310X) and exon 20 insertion/
duplication mutations, not all single-nucleotide or double-nucleotide changes in ERBB2 are activating and not all potentially activating 
mutations were studied in pivotal trials.
	
– The definition of an activating mutation is evolving. FDA approved agents may differ in which mutations are considered on-label, with 
one agent requiring presence of an activating mutation (with individual mutations not specified) while two other agents are approved 
for tyrosine kinase domain mutations.
	
– For oncogenic or likely oncogenic ERBB2 (HER2) mutations, refer to definitions at oncokb.org. 
 ◊Testing methodologies: While targeted PCR techniques can be utilized to examine ERBB2 mutations, the diversity and  
spectrum of mutations are best surveyed using NGS-based approaches.

• Molecular Targets for Analysis (continued)
HER2 protein overexpression: HER2, encoded by ERBB2, can be overexpressed in a variety of malignancies.
 ◊At this time, there is no recommendation regarding specific IHC antibody clone for HER2 staining in NSCLC.
 ◊Scoring criteria for anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody/antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy is currently based on criteria initially applied 
in gastric carcinoma, which utilizes different scoring criteria than that utilized for breast carcinoma and employs different scoring criteria 
for small biopsy specimens versus resections. 
HGFR (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) (MET) protein overexpression: HGFR/MET, encoded by the MET gene, is a receptor tyrosine 
kinase found on the surface of normal epithelial cells that can be overexpressed within NSCLC.
 ◊High HGFR (MET) protein expression levels are associated with responsiveness to specific antibody drug conjugate agents.
 ◊Evaluation for HGFR (MET) protein expression is distinct from evaluation of MET amplification and MET exon 14 skipping events.
 ◊Testing Methodologies: IHC is the required method for detection of HGFR (MET) protein expression. 
	
– The antibody clone SP44 is currently the only reagent shown to be an effective predictor of response to ADC therapy. 
	
– Laboratories using modifications to the FDA-approved methodology for SP44 or alternate clones must demonstrate comparability to 
SP44 with the approved methodology.
	
– A positive result is considered 3+ staining in ≥50% of tumor cells.
	
– NGS, RT-PCR, and FISH are not methods for detection of HGFR (MET) protein expression.
NTRK1/2/3 (neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase) gene fusions
 ◊The presence of NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions is associated with responsiveness to oral TRK inhibitors.
 ◊NTRK1/2/3 are tyrosine receptor kinases that are rarely rearranged in NSCLC as well as in other tumor types, resulting in dysregulation 
and inappropriate signaling. 
 ◊Numerous fusion partners have been identified. 
 ◊To date, no specific clinicopathologic features, other than absence of other driver alterations, have been identified in association with 
these fusions. 
 ◊Point mutations in NTRK1/2/3 are generally non-activating and have not been studied in association with targeted therapy.
 ◊Testing Methodologies: Various methodologies can be used to detect NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions, including: FISH, IHC, PCR, and NGS; false 
negatives may occur. IHC methods are complicated by baseline expression in some tissues. FISH testing may require at least 3 probe 
sets for full analysis. NGS testing can detect a broad range of alterations. DNA-based NGS may under-detect NTRK1 and NTRK3 fusions.

PRINCIPLES OF BIOMARKER ANALYSIS 
• PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1): PD-L1 is a co-regulatory molecule that can be expressed on tumor cells and inhibit T-cell–mediated cell 
death. T cells express PD-1, a negative regulator, which binds to ligands including PD-L1 (CD274) or PD-L2 (CD273). In the presence of PD-
L1, T-cell activity is suppressed.
Checkpoint inhibitor antibodies block the PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction, thereby improving the antitumor effects of endogenous T cells.
IHC for PD-L1 can be utilized to identify disease most likely to respond to first-line anti–PD-1/PD-L1.
 ◊Various antibody clones have been developed for IHC analysis of PD-L1 expression, and while several are comparable regarding 
intensity and proportion of cells stained, some are not.
	
– The definition of positive and negative testing is dependent on the individual antibody, clone, and platform deployed, which may 
be unique to each checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The approval of multiple different assays for PD-L1 has raised concern among both 
pathologists and oncologists.
	
– While some clones for PD-L1 IHC are FDA-approved for specific indications, use of multiple IHC tests is not routinely recommended, 
provided any individual IHC test has been internally validated for comparability for categorical results against the FDA-approved clone. 
	
– Interpretation of PD-L1 IHC in NSCLC is typically focused on the proportion of tumor cells expressing membranous staining at any 
level and therefore is a linear variable; scoring systems may be different in other tumor types. 
 ◊Although PD-L1 expression can be elevated in patients with an oncogenic driver, targeted therapy for certain oncogenic drivers should 
take precedence over treatment with an ICI.
• Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) Testing: 
Some laboratories offer testing for molecular alterations examining nucleic acids in peripheral circulation, most commonly in processed 
plasma. 
ctDNA testing should not be used in lieu of a histologic tissue diagnosis.
ctDNA is not routinely recommended in settings other than advanced/metastatic disease. For stages I–III, tissue-based testing is preferred. 
Molecular testing of tissue may have a higher yield in the setting of metastatic disease confined to the thorax. 
Studies have demonstrated ctDNA and tissue testing to have very high specificity. Both ctDNA and tissue testing have appreciable false-
negative rates, supporting the complementarity of these approaches, and data support complementary testing to reduce turnaround time 
and increase yield of targetable alteration detection.
 ◊Limitations of ctDNA testing that can impact interpretation include:
	
– Low tumor fraction/ctDNA; some assays include a measure of ctDNA fraction, which can aid in identification of situations in which low 
ctDNA fraction might suggest compromised sensitivity 
	
– The presence of mutations from sites other than the target lesion, most commonly clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential 
(CHIP) or post-chemotherapy marrow clones. KRAS and TP53 can be seen in either of these circumstances
	
– The inherent ability of the assay to detect fusions or other genomic variation of relevance
 ◊Limitations of tissue testing that can impact interpretation include:
	
– Low tumor percent in a sample not sufficiently mitigated by tumor enrichment or high analytic sensitivity methods
	
– The inherent ability of the assay to detect fusions or other genomic variation of relevance
• Germline Testing
 ◊Consider referral to genetic counseling if a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant is identified on somatic testing in which there is either 
molecular or clinical concern for germline predisposition syndrome.

PRINCIPLES OF BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
• Testing in the setting of a limited number of pulmonary nodules should be considered to distinguish separate primary lung carcinoma 
versus intrapulmonary metastatic disease.
Studies to explore tumor relatedness by testing tissue from separately sampled lesions using an MGPT approach suggest it may be 
superior to histopathologic assessment. 
Tumor pairs exhibiting entirely non-overlapping, unique mutations are considered clonally unrelated separate primary lung cancers, 
even if histologically similar. Tumors that share multiple (≥2) mutations are more likely to be clonally related; however, this may depend 
on the extent to which any individual mutation is extremely common in NSCLC and whether identified alterations are driver or passenger 
alterations. Results in which no mutations or only one mutation are identified are not informative for this evaluation.
• Testing in the Setting of Progression on Targeted Therapy:
For any patient with progression on targeted therapy, histologic transformation (such as small cell) is a possible mechanism of resistance. 
Tissue biopsy of a progressing lesion should be considered to evaluate morphology and biomarker analysis.
PET/CT can be used to identify optimal biopsy targets in the setting of progression.
At time of progression, consider ctDNA and tissue-based testing in parallel to identify resistance mechanisms.
For many of the above listed analytes, there is growing recognition of the molecular mechanisms of resistance to therapy. Re-testing of a 
sample from a tumor that is actively progressing while exposed to targeted therapy can shed light on appropriate next therapeutic steps:
 ◊For patients with an underlying EGFR sensitizing mutation who have been treated with EGFR TKI, minimum appropriate testing includes: 	
– High-sensitivity evaluation for p.T790M if patient previously treated with a first- or second-generation EGFR TKI. Assays for the 
detection of EGFR p.T790M should be designed to have an analytic sensitivity of a minimum of 5% allelic fraction. The original 
sensitizing mutation can be utilized as an internal control in many assays to determine whether a p.T790M is within the range of 
detection if present as a subclonal event. The presence of p.T790M can direct patients to third-generation EGFR TKI therapy.
– Alternate mechanisms of resistance (eg, MET and/or ERBB2 amplification, gene fusions, new driver mutation [bypass signaling event]) 
may be used to direct patients for additional therapies.  
 ◊For patients with underlying ALK gene fusion who have been treated with ALK TKI, it is unclear whether identification of specific tyrosine 
kinase domain mutation can identify appropriate next steps in therapy, although some preliminary data suggest that specific kinase 
domain mutations may impact the next line of therapy. 
 ◊	MGPT may be the most informative approach to examining potential mechanisms of resistance, which may require more than one 
instance of such profiling over the course of an individual patient’s therapy. Assay methodology selection can impact the ability to 
identify subclonal events in this setting.

PRINCIPLES OF BIOMARKER-DIRECTED THERAPY FOR ADVANCED OR METASTATIC DISEASE
General Principles
• Contraindications for treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may include active or previously documented autoimmune disease and/or 
current use of immunosuppressive agents; some oncogenic drivers (ie, EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation; ALK, RET, or ROS1 gene 
fusions) have been shown to be associated with less benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. If there are contraindications, refer to NSCL-K 1 of 5 
(adenocarcinoma) or NSCL-K 2 of 6 (squamous cell carcinoma). 
• An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any recommended systemic biologic therapy. 
• Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV atezolizumab. Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs 
has different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV atezolizumab. 
• Pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab and 
berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph has different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV pembrolizumab.
• If progression on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, using a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is not recommended.
• Criteria for treatment with bevacizumab include nonsquamous NSCLC and no recent history of hemoptysis. Any regimen with a high risk of 
thrombocytopenia and the potential risk of bleeding should be used with caution in combination with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab should not 
be given as a single agent, unless as maintenance if initially used with chemotherapy. Bevacizumab should be given until progression. 
Monitoring
• During Initial Therapy: Response assessment after 2 cycles, then every 2–4 cycles with CT of known or high-risk sites of disease (eg, 
chest, abdomen, pelvis) with or without contrast or when clinically indicated. Timing of CT scans within Guidelines parameters is a clinical 
decision.
• During Subsequent Therapy or Maintenance Therapy: Response assessment with CT of known or high-risk sites of disease (eg, chest, 
abdomen, pelvis) with or without contrast every 6–12 weeks. Timing of CT scans within Guidelines parameters is a clinical decision. 
• Biomarker-Directed Therapy References 
• PD-L1 ≥50% First-Line Therapy 
• PD-L1 ≥1%–49% First-Line Therapy 
• PD-L1 <1%

PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY FOR ADVANCED OR METASTATIC DISEASE
General Principles
• Contraindications for treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may include active or previously documented autoimmune disease and/or current use of 
immunosuppressive agents; some oncogenic drivers (ie, EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation; ALK, RET, or ROS1 gene fusions) have been 
shown to be associated with less benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. 
• An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any recommended systemic biologic therapy. 
• Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV atezolizumab. Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs has different 
dosing and administration instructions compared to IV atezolizumab. 
• Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is not approved for concurrent use with IV ipilimumab; however, for nivolumab monotherapy, nivolumab and 
hyaluronidase-nvhy subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV nivolumab. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy has different dosing and 
administration instructions compared to IV nivolumab. 
• Pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab and 
berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph has different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV pembrolizumab.
• Albumin-bound paclitaxel may be substituted for either paclitaxel or docetaxel in patients who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions after 
receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel despite premedication, or for patients where the standard premedications (ie, dexamethasone, H2 blockers, H1 
blockers) are contraindicated. 
• Carboplatin-based regimens are often used for patients with comorbidities or those who cannot tolerate cisplatin. 
• If first-line systemic therapy is completed before treatment for an actionable mutation, and disease has progressed, see Subsequent Therapy. 
• If progression on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, using a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is not recommended. 
• Criteria for treatment with bevacizumab include nonsquamous NSCLC and no recent history of hemoptysis. Any regimen with a high risk of 
thrombocytopenia and the potential risk of bleeding should be used with caution in combination with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab should not be given as 
a single agent, unless as maintenance if initially used with chemotherapy. Bevacizumab should be given until progression. 
• For lazertinib + amivantamab-vmjw, prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended at the time of initiation to prevent venous thromboembolic events. 
• For lazertinib + amivantamab-vmjw, prophylaxis with oral doxycycline or minocycline, clindamycin lotion applied to the scalp, chlorhexidine applied 
to nails, and a ceramide-based non-comedogenic moisturizer is recommended to reduce dermatologic adverse events. Prophylaxis with oral 
dexamethasone 8 mg for 2 days prior to first dose is recommended to reduce infusion-related reactions (IRRs) with amivantamab-vmjw.
Monitoring
• During Initial Therapy: Response assessment after 2 cycles, then every 2–4 cycles with CT of known or high-risk sites of disease (eg, chest, abdomen, 
pelvis) with or without contrast or when clinically indicated. Timing of CT scans within Guidelines parameters is a clinical decision. 
• During Subsequent Therapy or Maintenance Therapy: Response assessment with CT of known or high-risk sites of disease (eg, chest, abdomen, 
pelvis) with or without contrast every 6–12 weeks. Timing of CT scans within Guidelines parameters is a clinical decision.  
• Systemic Therapy for Adenocarcinoma, Large Cell, NSCLC NOS
• Systemic Therapy for Squamous Cell Carcinoma
• Maintenance Therapy
• Subsequent Therapy and Progression

Overview 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United 
States.1,2 In 2024, an estimated 234,580 new cases (116,310 in males 
and 118,270 in females) of lung and bronchial cancer will be diagnosed, 
and 125,070 people (65,790 males and 59,280 females) will die because 
of the disease.1 It is estimated that 25.4% of patients with lung and 
bronchial cancers are alive 5 years or more after diagnosis; this includes 
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and those with small 
cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the United States from 2013 through 2019.3 
The overall 5-year relative survival rate among those with 
adenocarcinoma histology was 32.2%.3 Since 2006, the incidence of 
lung cancer has decreased annually by 2.5% in males and 1% in 
females.1 It is estimated that 81% of lung cancer deaths in 2024 will be 
caused directly by cigarette smoking.1  
There have been significant improvements in the treatment of lung 
cancer, including advances in screening; minimally invasive techniques 
for diagnosis and treatment; radiation therapy (RT), including stereotactic 
ablative radiotherapy (SABR); as well as new targeted therapies and 
immunotherapies.4-9 The availability of these new treatments is 
associated with improved survival rates for patients with NSCLC. From 
2015 to 2016, 2-year relative survival for NSCLC was 42% compared 
with 34% from 2009 to 2010.10 Patients with NSCLC who are eligible for 
targeted therapies or immunotherapies are now surviving longer; 5-year 
survival rates range from 15% to 62.5%, depending on the biomarker.9,11-
27 Therefore, biomarker testing is critical to guide treatment selection and 
ensure optimal outcomes in patients with NSCLC, particularly for those 
with advanced or metastatic disease.

Guidelines Update Methodology 
The complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN 
Guidelines are available at www.NCCN.org. 
Literature Search Criteria 
Prior to the update of the NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung 
Cancer, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to 
obtain key literature in NSCLC published since the previous Guidelines 
update, using the search term: non-small cell lung cancer. The PubMed 
database was chosen because it is the most widely used resource for 
medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature. The 
search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in 
English. Results were confined to the following article types: Clinical Trial, 
Phase 2; Clinical Trial, Phase 3; Clinical Trial, Phase 4; Guideline; 
Meta-Analysis; Randomized Controlled Trial; Systematic Reviews; and 
Validation Studies. Data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from 
additional sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines as discussed 
by the panel during the Guidelines update have been included in this 
version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high-level 
evidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of lower-level 
evidence and expert opinion.  
Sensitive/Inclusive Language Usage 
NCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of 
equity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use 
language that is person-first; not stigmatizing; anti-racist, anti-classist, 
anti-misogynist, anti-ageist, anti-ableist, and anti-fat-biased; and inclusive 
of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN 
Guidelines incorporate non-gendered language, instead focusing on 
organ-specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate 
and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will 
continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing 
statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do 
not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender 
data are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. 
If sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs 
present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender 
individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in 
future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate 
language in their future analyses. 
Risk Factors 
The primary risk factor for lung cancer is smoking tobacco, which accounts 
for most lung cancer-related deaths.2,28-32 Approximately 350 people die 
every day from lung cancer in the United States; most of these deaths 
(81%) are caused by cigarette smoking.33 Cigarette smoke contains many 
carcinogenic chemicals (eg, nitrosamines, benzo(a)pyrene diol 
epoxide).31,34 The risk for lung cancer increases with the number of packs 
of cigarettes smoked per day and with the number of years spent smoking 
(ie, pack-years of smoking history). Individuals who do not smoke also 
have an increased relative risk (RR = 1.24) of developing lung cancer if 
they are exposed to tobacco smoke from those who smoke, termed 
second-hand smoke; other studies have reported a modest risk (hazard 
ratio [HR], 1.05).29,34-37  
Other possible risk factors for lung cancer include disease history (eg, 
COPD), cancer history, family history of lung cancer, and exposure to 
other carcinogens (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, 
available at www.NCCN.org).38,39 The International Agency for Research 
on Cancer lists several agents known to cause lung cancer, including 
arsenic, asbestos, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, coal smoke, diesel fumes, nickel, silica, soot, and uranium. Asbestos is known

=== PAGE 130 ===
carcinogen that increases the risk for lung cancer in people exposed to 
airborne fibers, especially in individuals who smoke cigarettes. It is 
estimated that about 3% to 4% of lung cancers are caused by asbestos 
exposure.43 Asbestos also causes pleural mesothelioma (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for Mesothelioma: Pleural, available at www.NCCN.org). 
Radon gas, a radioactive gas that is produced by the decay of radium 226, 
also seems to cause lung cancer. 
It is not clear whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT) affects the risk 
for lung cancer in women. More than 20 studies have been published, but 
the results have been inconsistent. In a large randomized controlled study, 
no increase in the incidence of lung cancer was found among 
postmenopausal women treated with estrogen plus progestin HRT; 
however, the risk of death increased in those with NSCLC.44 In women 
who received estrogen alone, the incidence or risk of death from lung 
cancer did not increase.45  
Smoking Cessation 
Approximately 85% to 90% of cases of lung cancer are caused by 
cigarette smoking.30 Of patients aged 20 to 49 years who were recently 
diagnosed with lung cancer, 81% of men and 72% of the women had 
smoked.46 Active smoking causes lung cancer; individuals who formerly 
smoked are at increased risk for lung cancer compared with those who 
have never smoked. There is a causal relationship between active 
smoking and lung cancer and also between other cancers (eg, bladder, 
cervical, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, kidney, laryngeal, oral cavity, 
ovarian cancer, pancreatic, pharyngeal) and other diseases and 
conditions.30 Smoking harms nearly every organ in the body; individuals 
who smoke have increased mortality compared with those who do not 
smoke.47 Those who do not smoke, but live with someone who smokes, 
have an increased risk for lung cancer due to secondhand smoke.35 
Further complicating this problem, cigarettes also contain nicotine, which 
is a highly addictive substance.  
Oncologists should encourage smoking cessation, especially in patients 
with cancer (see the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation, available 
at www.NCCN.org).48-51 The 5 A’s framework is a useful tool (that is, Ask, 
Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange).52 It is in the best interest of patients to 
quit smoking tobacco. Persistent smoking is associated with second 
primary cancers, treatment complications, and decreased survival.53 Some 
surgeons will not operate on individuals who currently smoke, because 
active smoking may increase postoperative pulmonary complications.54 
However, active smoking should not be used to exclude patients with 
early-stage lung cancer from surgical treatment that will prolong survival. 
Programs using behavioral counseling combined with medications that 
promote smoking cessation (approved by the FDA) can be very useful.55 
The American Cancer Society (ACS) has resources on How to Quit Using 
Tobacco. 
Agents that can be used to promote smoking cessation include nicotine 
replacement (eg, gum, inhaler, lozenge, nasal spray, patch), bupropion 
sustained release, and varenicline.56,57 A study suggests that cytisine is 
more efficacious than nicotine replacement therapy, although more side 
effects were reported with cytisine such as nausea, vomiting, and sleep 
disorders.58 Studies have shown that varenicline is better than bupropion 
or nicotine patch for smoking cessation.59-61 The effectiveness of 
varenicline for preventing relapse has not been clearly established.62 The 
FDA has issued an alert for varenicline regarding neuropsychiatric 
symptoms. Varenicline has also been associated with visual disturbances, 
movement disorders, unconsciousness, and cardiovascular disorders; 
therefore, it is banned in truck and bus drivers, pilots, and air traffic 
controllers.63-66 Other side effects of varenicline include nausea, abnormal dreams, insomnia and headache. Bupropin may also be

=== PAGE 131 ===
associated with similar serious neuropsychiatric symptoms. Nicotine 
replacement has fewer adverse effects than varenicline or bupropion.69 In 
spite of the potential adverse effects, it is probably more beneficial for 
motivated patients to use agents to promote smoking cessation.69  
Lung Cancer Screening 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide in men, and 
late diagnosis is a major obstacle to improving lung cancer outcomes.2,70,71 
The feasibility of lung cancer screening was assessed because localized 
cancer can be managed with curative intent and because the mortality rate 
in other solid tumors (eg, cervix, colon) seems to be decreased by 
screening, early detection, and prompt treatment.  
The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) (ACRIN Protocol A6654), a 
phase 3 randomized trial, assessed the risks and benefits of low-dose CT 
scans compared with chest radiographs for detecting lung cancer in more 
than 53,000 individuals with a long-term history of smoking cigarettes—
including those who currently or previously smoked.72 The NLST showed 
that screening individuals with high-risk factors using low-dose CT 
decreased the mortality rate from lung cancer by 20%.73 Individuals who 
currently or previously smoked cigarettes were categorized as high risk for 
lung cancer if they had a 30 or more pack-year smoking history 
(individuals who previously smoked had quit smoking up to 15 years 
before enrollment), were 55 to 74 years of age, and had no evidence of 
lung cancer.72,74 NELSON, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed low-dose 
CT screening in 15,789 individuals at high risk for lung cancer based on 
age and smoking history; 85% were men.75 Individuals were aged 50 to 74 
years and currently smoked or had quit smoking within the last 10 years. 
At 10 years of follow-up, NELSON demonstrated a reduction in lung 
cancer mortality in men of 24% (cumulative rate ratio for death from lung 
cancer: 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61–0.94; P = .01).  
The NCCN, ACS, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), 
American College of Chest Physicians, European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO), and other organizations recommend lung cancer 
screening using low-dose CT for select high-risk individuals who either 
currently or previously smoked cigarettes based on clinical trial data (see 
the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, available at 
www.NCCN.org).75-80 Low-dose CT screening and follow-up are not a 
substitute for smoking cessation; patients should be offered smoking 
cessation counseling (see NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation, 
available at www.NCCN.org).  
Classification and Prognostic Factors  
WHO divides lung cancer into two major classes based on its biology, 
therapy, and prognosis: NSCLC (discussed in these guidelines) and SCLC 
(see the NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer, available at 
www.NCCN.org).81-84 NSCLC accounts for more than 80% of all lung 
cancer cases, and it includes two major types: 1) nonsquamous, including 
adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other subtypes; and 2) 
squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma.85 Adenocarcinoma is the most 
common subtype of lung cancer seen in the United States and is also the 
most frequently occurring histology in individuals who have never smoked 
cigarettes. The lung adenocarcinoma classification was developed by an 
international panel and adopted by WHO (see the Pathologic Evaluation of 
Lung Cancer in this Discussion).81-84,86 All NSCLC should be classified 
according to subtype using the WHO Guidelines.81,82,84 The guidelines 
contain an extensive pathology section (see Principles of Pathologic 
Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC and Pathologic Evaluation of 
Lung Cancer in this Discussion). Certain prognostic factors are predictive 
of survival in patients with NSCLC. Good prognostic factors include 
early-stage disease at diagnosis, good performance status (PS) (ECOG 0, 
1) no significant weight loss (<5%) and female gender 87

Diagnostic Evaluation  
Incidental Lung Nodules  
Lung cancer screening is recommended for early diagnosis in 
asymptomatic patients at high risk for cancer.72,75 Risk assessment is used 
to determine which individuals are at high risk for lung cancer and thus are 
candidates for screening with low-dose CT.88 Clinicians are referred to the 
NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening for risk assessment criteria 
to determine which patients are eligible for screening and for how to 
evaluate and follow up on low-dose CT screening findings.89 The NCCN 
Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening have been revised to harmonize 
with the LungRADs system developed by the American College of 
Radiology with the goal of decreasing the false-positive low-dose CT 
screening results reported in the NLST.90  
The diagnostic algorithm for incidental pulmonary nodules in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC incorporates information from the NCCN Guidelines 
for Lung Cancer Screening. The diagnostic algorithms for incidental solid 
and subsolid lung nodules, which are detected on chest CT, use cutoff 
thresholds of 6 mm for a positive scan result based on the Fleischner 
criteria (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).91-95 Note that the 
Fleischner Society Guidelines do not specify whether a CT with contrast is 
necessary for follow-up or whether a low-dose CT is sufficient. Low-dose 
CT is a preferred recommendation in the NCCN Guidelines unless 
contrast enhancement is needed for better diagnostic resolution.  
Solid and subsolid nodules are the two main types of pulmonary nodules 
that may be seen on chest CT scans. The Fleischner Society has 
recommendations for patients with solid and subsolid nodules.92,93 
Subsolid nodules include: 1) nonsolid nodules also known as ground-glass 
opacities (GGOs) or ground-glass nodules (GGNs); and 2) part-solid 
nodules which contain both ground-glass and solid components 93,96-98
invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), formerly known as bronchioloalveolar 
carcinoma (BAC) (see Adenocarcinoma in this Discussion); patients have 
5-year disease-free survival of 100% if these nonsolid nodules are 
completely resected.86,93,96,97,99-101 Data suggest that many nonsolid 
nodules discovered incidentally on CT imaging will resolve and many of 
those that persist may not progress to clinically significant cancer.99,102,103 
Solid and part-solid nodules are more likely to be invasive, faster-growing 
cancers, factors that are reflected in the increased suspicion and follow-up 
of these nodules (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, 
available at www.NCCN.org).89,92,93  
All findings and factors for a patient need to be carefully evaluated in a 
multidisciplinary diagnostic team before establishing a diagnosis of lung 
cancer and before starting treatment. The NCCN Guidelines recommend 
biopsy or surgical excision for highly suspicious nodules seen on low-dose 
CT scans or further surveillance for nodules with a low suspicion of 
cancer, depending on the type of nodule and a multidisciplinary evaluation 
of other patient factors (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer 
Screening, available at www.NCCN.org). For patients having repeat 
scans, the most important radiologic factor is change or stability of a 
nodule when compared with a previous imaging study. False-positive 
results (eg, benign intrapulmonary lymph nodes, noncalcified granulomas) 
frequently occurred with low-dose CT when using the original cutoffs for 
nodule size deemed suspicious for malignancy from the NLST.73 The 
revised cutoff values for suspicious nodules recommended by the 
American College of Radiology and incorporated into the LungRADs 
system have been reported to decrease the false-positive rate from 
low-dose CT.104-106  
Larger Tumors 
The NCCN Guidelines recommend that the diagnostic strategy should be individualised to each patient depending on the size and loacation of the

tumor, the presence of mediastinal or distant disease, patient 
characteristics (eg, comorbidities), and local expertise. The diagnostic 
strategy needs to be decided in a multidisciplinary setting. Decisions about 
whether a biopsy (including what type of biopsy) or surgical excision is 
appropriate depend on several factors as outlined in the NSCLC algorithm, 
which were revised by the NCCN Panel for the 2023 update (Version 1) 
(see Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). For example, the NCCN Panel clarified that a preoperative 
biopsy may be useful for patients with early-stage NSCLC (ie, clinical 
stage IB or more) who may be candidates for systemic therapy before 
surgery (also known as neoadjuvant, induction, or preoperative 
therapy).107 A preoperative biopsy may be appropriate if an intraoperative 
diagnosis seems to be difficult or very risky (such as a small and central 
lesion, where it is difficult to do a wedge or intraoperative core needle 
biopsy). The preferred biopsy technique depends on the disease site and 
is described in the NSCLC algorithm. For example, radial endobronchial 
ultrasound (EBUS; also known as endosonography), navigational 
bronchoscopy, or transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) are 
recommended for patients with suspected peripheral nodules.108  
PET/CT imaging is useful before selecting a biopsy site, because it is 
better to biopsy the site that will confer the highest stage. For patients with 
suspected nodal disease, pathologic mediastinal lymph node evaluation is 
recommended with either noninvasive or invasive staging methods, 
including endoscopic ultrasound–guided fine-needle aspiration 
(EUS-FNA), EBUS–guided transbronchial needle aspiration 
(EBUS-TBNA), navigational bronchoscopy, robotic bronchoscopy, or 
mediastinoscopy (see Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Clinicians use both noninvasive and invasive 
methods when staging patients.109 The panel decided that a preoperative 
bronchoscopy may also be preferred for tissue diagnosis and/or 
mediastinal staging (EBUS) EBUS provides access to nodal stations
2R/2L, 3P, 4R/4L, 7, 10R/10L, 11 to 13, and other hilar nodal stations. 
EUS provides access to nodal stations 5, 7, 8, and 9. 
If pathology results from biopsy or surgical excision indicate a diagnosis of 
NSCLC, then further evaluation and staging need to be done so that the 
patient’s health care team can determine the most appropriate and 
effective treatment plan (see Pathologic Evaluation of Lung Cancer, 
Staging, and Clinical Evaluation in this Discussion and the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Diagnosis, staging, and planned resection (eg, 
lobectomy) are ideally one operative procedure for patients with 
early-stage disease (see the Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). A preoperative or intraoperative tissue 
diagnosis of lung cancer should be established before doing a lobectomy, 
bi-lobectomy, or pneumonectomy. If a preoperative or intraoperative tissue 
diagnosis appears risky or unreliable, multidisciplinary evaluation—that 
includes interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and interventional 
pulmonology—is recommended to determine the safest and most efficient 
approach, or to provide consensus that a biopsy is too risky or difficult and 
that anatomic resection can occur without tissue confirmation of lung 
cancer.  
Pathologic Evaluation of Lung Cancer  
Pathologic evaluation is done to determine whether patients have primary 
lung cancer or metastatic cancer, classify the histologic subtype of the 
lung cancer, determine the extent of invasion, establish whether the 
surgical margins contain cancer (ie, positive or negative margins), and 
conduct biomarker diagnostic studies to assess for certain somatic, 
disease-associated variants/mutations (eg, EGFR mutations) or immune 
biomarkers (eg, PD-L1) (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).110 Targeted therapy is potentially very effective in 
patients with NSCLC and specific driver mutations, such as EGFR 
mutations; therefore tissue needs to be conserved for molecular testing

=== PAGE 134 ===
(see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).7,111-120 All specimens should be assessed 
morphologically, including routine staining approaches such as 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology (or relevant stains for cytology 
specimens). Cytology may be sufficient to distinguish adenocarcinomas 
from squamous cell carcinomas.121 Ideally, a diagnosis of NSCLC can be 
done using H&E findings, clinical findings, imaging studies, and the 
patient’s history, which will conserve tissue for molecular analyses. If 
necessary, immunohistochemistry (IHC) should be used to distinguish 
adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, metastatic malignancy, and 
primary pleural mesothelioma (particularly for pleural samplings) (see 
Immunohistochemistry for Diagnosis of NSCLC in this Discussion).122 
Typically, treatment is not recommended until the patient has been 
diagnosed with NSCLC. 
Preoperative evaluations include examination of the following: bronchial 
brushings, bronchial washings, sputum, FNA biopsy, core needle biopsy, 
endobronchial biopsy, and transbronchial biopsy.108,123 Minimally invasive 
techniques can be used to obtain specimens in patients with advanced 
unresectable NSCLC;124,125 however, diagnosis may be more difficult when 
using small biopsies and cytology.100 When available, rapid on-site 
evaluation (ROSE) may be used to ensure that transbronchial needle 
aspirates or EBUS specimens are adequate for diagnosis and biomarker 
testing.126-130 The mediastinal lymph nodes are systematically sampled to 
determine the staging and therapeutic options. Other lung diseases also 
need to be ruled out, such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and 
coccidioidomycosis.131-133 Lobectomy or pneumonectomy specimens are 
evaluated intraoperatively to determine the surgical resection margin 
status, diagnose incidental nodules discovered at the time of surgery, or 
evaluate the regional lymph nodes.  
Postoperative evaluation provides the pathology characteristics necessary 
for the classification of tumor type, staging, and prognostic factors. The 
surgical pathology report should include the WHO histologic classification 
for carcinomas of the lung.82-84,134 The classification for lung 
adenocarcinoma was determined by an international panel and adopted 
by the WHO (see Adenocarcinoma in this Discussion).82-84,86 The 
classification recommends IHC and molecular studies (see Principles of 
Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).82,135 The use of 
general categories—such as non-small cell carcinoma (NSCC) or NSCC 
not otherwise specified (NOS)—should be minimized, because more 
effective treatment can be selected when the histology is known.  
Major subtypes of NSCLC include adenocarcinoma, squamous cell 
carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, carcinoid 
tumor, and less common subtypes that are not discussed here (see 
Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). All 
NSCLC should be classified according to subtype using the WHO 
Guidelines.82,84 Ideally, the subtype should be specified. The general 
terms NSCC or NSCC NOS should be used infrequently and only when a 
more specific diagnosis cannot be obtained by morphology and/or 
special staining. The purpose of the pathologic evaluation of NSCLC 
varies depending on whether the sample is 1) intended for initial 
diagnosis in a case of suspected NSCLC; 2) a definitive resection 
sample; or 3) obtained for molecular evaluation in the setting of an 
established NSCLC diagnosis. Further details are provided in the 
algorithm.  
Adenocarcinomas include AIS, MIA, invasive adenocarcinomas, and 
invasive adenocarcinoma variants (see Adenocarcinoma in this 
Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Squamous cell 
carcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor that 1) shows either 
keratinization and/or intercellular bridges; or 2) is an undifferentiated
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 135 ===
NSCC that demonstrates positivity for squamous cell carcinoma markers 
by IHC. Adenosquamous carcinomas are tumors with mixed 
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma components; each 
component comprises at least 10% of the tumor. Molecular testing is 
recommended if any adenocarcinoma component is present in a biopsy 
specimen that is otherwise squamous. Large cell carcinomas are tumors 
lacking morphologic or IHC evidence of clear lineage, with negative or 
uninformative stains for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. 
The diagnosis of large cell carcinoma requires a thoroughly sampled 
resected tumor and cannot be made on non-resected or cytology 
specimens. Large cell carcinoma cannot be accurately identified using 
small samples because of challenges with complete assessment of the 
lesion.86 Immunohistochemical stains that exclude adenocarcinoma 
(TTF1, Napsin A) and squamous cell carcinoma (p40, p63) need to be 
used before making a diagnosis of large cell carcinoma; mucin stain is 
also recommended to assess for occult glandular differentiation. 
Carcinoid tumors are treated using the neuroendocrine guidelines and 
not the NSCLC guidelines; however, they are part of the differential 
diagnosis of pulmonary lesions (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors, available at www.NCCN.org). Care 
should be taken to distinguish typical carcinoids from atypical carcinoids 
by assessing for necrosis (see the NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung 
Cancer, available at www.NCCN.org.)  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends molecular testing for eligible 
patients with metastatic NSCLC because FDA-approved agents for lung 
cancer are available for actionable biomarkers (see Testing for Molecular 
Biomarkers in this Discussion). Molecular testing is recommended for 
patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and 
NSCLC NOS. Testing may be considered for patients with metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma.136,137 The NCCN NSCLC Panel also 
recommends PD-L1 IHC testing (category 1) in all patients with metastatic
NSCLC because FDA-approved immunotherapy agents are available for 
this immune biomarker (see Testing for Immune Biomarkers in this 
Discussion).138  
Adenocarcinoma  
Most lung carcinomas are adenocarcinomas. The categories for 
adenocarcinoma include: 1) AIS, which is a preinvasive, typically solitary 
lesion that is usually non-mucinous; 2) MIA, which is a solitary and 
discrete non-mucinous lesion with a maximum area of invasion no greater 
than 0.5 cm; and 3) invasive adenocarcinoma variants (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Both AIS and MIA are associated with excellent 
survival if they are resected. The terms AIS and MIA should not be used 
for small samples because of challenges with complete assessment of the 
lesion.86 The categories of BAC or mixed subtype adenocarcinoma are no 
longer used to classify adenocarcinoma.86 The classification for lung 
adenocarcinoma was developed by an international panel and adopted by 
WHO.82-84,86 The lung classification recommends that use of general 
categories—NSCC and NSCC NOS—should be minimized, because more 
effective treatment can be selected when the specific subtype is known 
(see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).135 
Immunohistochemistry for Diagnosis of NSCLC 
To diagnose NSCLC in small tissue samples, judicious use of IHC is 
strongly recommended to conserve tumor tissue for molecular studies, 
especially in patients with advanced disease (see Principles of Pathologic 
Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).122,125,139 Note that the 
specific IHC analyses used to identify tumor type and lineage (eg, 
adenocarcinoma vs. squamous cell carcinoma) are distinct from the IHC 
analyses used to determine whether patients are candidates for anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor therapy or PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. If 
IHC should be used to distinguish adenocarcinoma, squamous
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 136 ===
cell carcinoma, metastatic malignancy, and primary pleural mesothelioma 
(particularly for pleural samplings).122 IHC is useful for assessing poorly 
differentiated NSCLC in small biopsy and/or cytology specimens.86,140  
Adenocarcinomas are usually positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 
(TTF-1), whereas squamous cell carcinomas are often negative for TTF-1 
and positive for p40 (or alternatively p63).86 Napsin A positivity occurs in 
more than 80% of lung adenocarcinomas and may also be useful in 
distinguishing adenocarcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma.141,142 Note 
that p63 can co-stain with TTF-1 or Napsin A in adenocarcinoma. In small 
biopsy specimens previously classified as NSCC NOS, a panel of TTF-1 
(or alternatively Napsin A) and p40 (or alternatively p63) may be sufficient 
to refine the diagnosis to either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell 
carcinoma. Thus, two markers may be sufficient to distinguish 
adenocarcinomas from squamous cell carcinomas.86,140 
An appropriate panel of IHC stains should include those relevant for 
evaluation of metastatic carcinomas to the lung if the primary origin of the 
carcinoma is uncertain. It is appropriate to first perform a limited panel of 
IHC to evaluate for NSCLC and, if negative, then proceed to additional 
IHC for evaluation of possible metastasis from a distant site. TTF-1 is very 
useful for distinguishing primary lung adenocarcinoma from metastatic 
adenocarcinoma, because most (70%–90%) non-mucinous primary 
adenocarcinomas are TTF-1 positive. TTF-1 is typically negative in 
squamous cell carcinoma.140 However, TTF-1 is also positive in tumors 
such as thyroid cancer and rarely in a few other organ systems.143 In 
addition, thyroglobulin and PAX8 are positive in tumors from patients with 
thyroid cancer, while they are negative in lung cancer. Immunomarkers 
that may be useful to assess for metastatic carcinoma to the lung include 
those for breast carcinoma (ERα, PR, GCDFP-15, mammaglobin, 
GATA-3), renal cell carcinoma (PAX8), papillary serous carcinoma (PAX8, 
PAX2, ER), and adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (CDX2) or 
prostate gland (NKX3.1). All typical and atypical carcinoid tumors are 
positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin.  
Although the cytologic diagnosis of NSCLC is generally reliable, it is 
more difficult to diagnose SCLC (see the NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell 
Lung Cancer, available at www.NCCN.org).108,140,144 Many patients with 
SCLC have characteristic CT and clinical findings (eg, massive 
lymphadenopathy, mediastinal invasion). Most SCLCs are 
immunoreactive for TTF-1; they are typically negative for CK34βE12 and 
p63.145,146 Many SCLCs also stain positively for markers of 
neuroendocrine differentiation, including insulinoma-associated protein 1 
(INSM1), CD56/NCAM, chromogranin, and synaptophysin. IHC should 
be used to confirm neuroendocrine differentiation only when appropriate 
morphologic features—speckled chromatin pattern, nuclear molding, and 
peripheral palisading—are present. CD56/NCAM, INSM1, chromogranin, 
and synaptophysin are used to identify neuroendocrine tumors if 
morphologic suspicion of neuroendocrine differentiation exists.147 One 
positive marker is sufficient if the staining is not ambiguous in more than 
10% of the tumor cells (TCs).  
Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare disease (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for Mesothelioma: Pleural, available at www.NCCN.org).148-150 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel feels that malignant mesothelioma and lung 
adenocarcinoma can be distinguished using clinical impression, imaging, 
and a limited panel of immunomarkers (if needed) to preserve tissue for 
molecular testing. Commonly used immunostains sensitive and specific for 
adenocarcinoma include pCEA, Claudin-4, TTF-1, and Napsin A (negative 
in mesothelioma). Other potentially useful markers include B72.3, 
Ber-EP4, MOC31, and CD15; however, these markers generally do not 
have the sensitivity and specificity of the commonly used markers. 
Immunostains sensitive and specific for pleural mesothelioma include 
WT-1, calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, and D2-40 (podoplanin antibody)
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 137 ===
(negative in adenocarcinoma).148-151 Broad epithelial markers such as 
keratin(s), as well as other lineage-specific markers, should be used when 
the differential diagnosis includes non-pulmonary and non-mesothelial 
lesions. Other markers can be useful in the differential diagnosis between 
mesothelioma and metastatic carcinoma to the lung (see Principles of 
Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). 
Staging  
The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (8th edition) is effective for all cancer 
cases recorded on or after January 1, 2018.152,153 The lung cancer 
staging system was revised by the International Association for the Study 
of Lung Cancer (IASLC)154-156 and was adopted by the AJCC.152,153,157,158 
The definitions for TNM and the stage grouping for the eighth edition are 
summarized in Tables 1 and 2 of the staging tables (see Staging in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). The descriptors of the TNM classification 
scheme are summarized in Table 3 of the staging tables.159 Early-stage 
disease is stages I and II with negative nodes (N0), whereas locally 
advanced disease is stages II and III with positive nodes (N+);160 
advanced or metastatic disease is stage IV. Pathologic staging uses both 
clinical staging information (which is noninvasive and includes medical 
history and physical [H&P] examination, and imaging) and other invasive 
staging procedures (eg, thoracotomy, examination of lymph nodes using 
mediastinoscopy).161  
From 2012 to 2018, the overall 5-year relative survival rate for 
adenocarcinoma was 29.6% in the United States; the 5-year survival rate 
for squamous cell carcinoma was 23%.162 The corresponding 5-year 
relative survival rates for adenocarcinoma were 70.1% for localized, 
44.7% for regional, 9.6% for distant, and 20% for unstaged.162 Five-year 
survival after lobectomy for pathologic stage I NSCLC ranges from 45% to 
65%, depending on whether the patient has stage 1A or 1B disease and 
on the location of the tumor 163 Another study in patients with stage I
disease (n = 19,702) found that 82% had surgical resection and their 
5-year overall survival was 54%; for untreated stage I NSCLC, 5-year 
overall survival was only 6%.164 Of patients with stage I disease who 
refused surgery (although it was recommended), 78% died of lung cancer 
within 5 years.  
Predictive and Prognostic Biomarkers 
Several biomarkers have emerged as predictive and prognostic markers 
for NSCLC. A predictive biomarker is indicative of therapeutic efficacy, 
because there is an interaction between the biomarker and therapy on 
patient outcome. A prognostic biomarker is indicative of patient survival 
independent of the treatment received, because the biomarker is an 
indicator of the innate tumor behavior (see KRAS Mutations in this 
Discussion). The NSCLC Panel recommends testing for certain molecular 
and immune biomarkers in all appropriate patients with NSCLC to assess 
whether patients are eligible for targeted therapies or immunotherapies 
based on data showing improvement in overall survival for patients 
receiving targeted therapies or immunotherapies compared with traditional 
chemotherapy regimens.18-25 Biomarker testing is recommended in 
eligible patients with stage IV disease, including M1a, M1b, and M1c. 
Testing for certain biomarkers is now also recommended in eligible 
patients with resectable early-stage NSCLC (see Combined Modality 
Therapy in this Discussion).  
Predictive molecular biomarkers include ALK rearrangements, BRAF 
p.V600E point mutations, EGFR mutations, v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic 
leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2) (also known as human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) mutations, Kirsten RAt 
Sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutations, mesenchymal-epithelial transition 
factor exon 14 (METex14) skipping mutations, neurotrophic tyrosine 
receptor kinase 1/2/3 (NTRK1/2/3) gene fusions, rearranged during 
transfection (RET) rearrangements and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1)
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 138 ===
gene rearrangements; PD-L1 expression is the predictive immune 
biomarker (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). For the 2023 update (Version 1), the 
NCCN NSCLC Panel added testing recommendations for ERBB2 
(HER2) mutations. Emerging predictive molecular biomarkers include 
high-level MET amplifications (see Emerging Biomarkers to Identify Novel 
Therapies for Patients with Metastatic NSCLC in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). Targeted agents are available for patients with NSCLC who have 
high-level MET amplifications.165-170 However, there are less data to 
support using these agents and they may not be FDA approved for 
NSCLC; therefore, they are referred to as emerging biomarkers. In 2020, 
the NCCN Panel deleted tumor mutational burden (TMB) as an emerging 
immune biomarker based on clinical trial data and other issues (see TMB 
in this Discussion).171,172  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends molecular testing based on clinical 
trial data, but strongly advises broader molecular profiling, to identify these 
and other rare driver mutations for which targeted therapies may be 
available to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate treatment; 
patients may be eligible for clinical trials for some of these targeted 
agents.173 Several online resources are available that describe NSCLC 
driver events, such as My Cancer Genome. Resources are available to 
assess whether the HER2 mutations are oncogenic or likely to be 
oncogenic (see oncoKB.org).174  
The presence of EGFR exon 19 deletions or EGFR exon 21 L858R 
mutations is predictive of treatment benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (EGFR TKI) therapy, such as osimertinib (see EGFR Mutations 
in this Discussion).175,176 Previously, these mutations were referred to as 
sensitizing EGFR mutations; however, the specific mutations are now 
described. The presence of EGFR exon 19 deletions or EGFR exon 21 
L858R mutations does not appear to be prognostic of survival for 
patients with NSCLC, independent of therapy.177 Molecular testing is also 
recommended in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC for less 
common EGFR mutations—such as EGFR S768I, L861Q, and G719X 
alterations—based on data showing the efficacy of certain EGFR TKIs 
(see NSCLC with EGFR Alterations in this Discussion). The panel also 
recommends testing for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations in eligible 
patients with metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy of 
novel agents as subsequent therapy options (see NSCLC with EGFR 
Alterations in this Discussion).178,179 All of these EGFR mutations can be 
assessed in the same assay, if the assay has been appropriately 
validated (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Because targeted polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR)-based methods for detecting EGFR mutations may 
under-detect EGFR exon 20 insertions, NGS-based strategies are 
preferred. The phrase subsequent therapy is used in these NCCN 
Guidelines instead of second-line or beyond therapy, because the line of 
therapy may vary depending on previous treatment with targeted agents.  
ALK rearrangements predict for benefit from targeted therapy such as 
alectinib, brigatinib, or lorlatinib (see ALK Gene Rearrangements in this 
Discussion). Testing for ALK rearrangements and EGFR mutations is 
recommended (category 1 for both) for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC NOS so that patients with these driver 
mutations can receive effective treatment with targeted agents (see 
Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC in this Discussion 
and the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).173,180-183 Testing for the other 
actionable mutations—including BRAF p.V600E, ERBB2 (HER2) 
mutations, KRAS, METex14 skipping, NTRK1/2/3, RET, and ROS1—is 
also recommended for nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC NOS because 
effective targeted agents are available.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 139 ===
Patients with metastatic NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma can also have 
actionable biomarkers, such as EGFR mutations, although at a lower 
incidence than those with metastatic NSCLC 
adenocarcinoma.136,137,184,185 Molecular testing for actionable alterations 
can be considered in patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma 
based on the effectiveness of targeted therapies.184,185 The NCCN Panel 
recommends that molecular testing be considered in all patients with 
metastatic NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma and not just those with 
certain characteristics, such as those who have never smoked 
cigarettes, with small biopsy specimens, and with mixed histology.  
For patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the NCCN NSCLC 
Panel currently recommends that a minimum of the following biomarkers 
should be assessed, including ALK rearrangements, BRAF mutations, 
EGFR mutations, ERBB2 (HER2) mutations, KRAS mutations, METex14 
skipping mutations, NTRK1/2/3 fusions, RET rearrangements, ROS1 
rearrangements, and PD-L1 expression levels; molecular testing can be 
considered in those with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. This list of 
recommended biomarkers has been revised as new oncogenic driver 
mutations were identified and new agents were approved. The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel also recommends molecular testing in eligible patients 
with metastatic NSCLC for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and for 
less common EGFR mutations, such as EGFR S768I, L861Q, and 
G719X. Patients with metastatic NSCLC may have other somatic genomic 
alterations for which targeted therapies may be available even if they are 
not FDA approved for NSCLC, such as high-level MET amplifications; 
these are referred to as emerging biomarkers (see Emerging Biomarkers 
to Identify Novel Therapies for Patients with Metastatic NSCLC in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).165-170 In 2020, the NCCN Panel deleted 
TMB as an emerging immune biomarker based on clinical trial data and 
other issues (see TMB in this Discussion).171 The NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC provide recommendations for individual biomarkers that should
be tested and recommend testing techniques but do not endorse any 
specific commercially available biomarker assays or commercial 
laboratories.186 Biomarker testing should be done at properly accredited 
laboratories (minimum of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments 
[CLIA] accreditation) (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis 
in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
ALK, BRAF p.V600E, EGFR, KRAS, METex14 skipping mutations, RET 
rearrangements, and ROS1 rearrangements do not usually overlap; thus, 
testing for KRAS mutations may identify patients who will not benefit from 
further molecular testing (also known as tiered testing approaches).185,187-
191 The KRAS oncogene is a prognostic biomarker. The presence of KRAS 
mutations is prognostic of poor survival for patients with NSCLC when 
compared to the absence of KRAS mutations, independent of therapy (see 
KRAS Mutations in this Discussion).192  
Information about biomarker testing and plasma circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA) testing (so-called “liquid biopsy”) for actionable mutations is 
included in the algorithm (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker 
Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Briefly, the panel feels that 
plasma ctDNA testing should not be used to diagnose NSCLC; tissue 
should be used to diagnose NSCLC. Standards and guidelines for plasma 
ctDNA testing for somatic variants/mutations have not been published, 
there is up to a 30% false-negative rate, and variants can be detected that 
are not related to the tumor (eg, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate 
potential [CHIP]).193,194 For example, an IDH1 mutation identified by 
plasma ctDNA testing is likely unrelated to NSCLC, given exceptionally 
low incidence, and is more likely to represent CHIP. Rare examples of 
CHIP with KRAS mutations have been described, suggesting caution in 
the interpretation of ctDNA findings.195 In addition, CHIP can be identified 
following prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy, further confounding 
interpretation of variants such as in TP53.196 Given the previous caveats,
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 140 ===
careful consideration is required to determine whether ctDNA findings 
reflect a true oncogenic driver or an unrelated finding. For the 2023 
update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel added a caveat that many, but not 
all, ctDNA tests use next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based 
technology.197  
However, plasma ctDNA testing can be used in specific circumstances if 
1) the patient is not medically fit for invasive tissue sampling; or 2) there is 
insufficient tissue for molecular analysis and follow-up tissue-based 
analysis will be done if an oncogenic driver is not identified.198,199 Data 
suggest that plasma ctDNA testing is a useful minimally invasive test that 
can be used to identify ALK, BRAF, EGFR, HER2, MET exon 14 skipping, 
RET, ROS1, and other oncogenic biomarkers that would not otherwise be 
identified in patients with metastatic NSCLC.197,200-202 Molecular testing of 
plasma ctDNA should be done using clinically validated tests.197  
Testing for Molecular Biomarkers 
Molecular testing is used to test for oncogenic genomic driver events for 
which targeted therapies are available; these somatic genomic alterations 
(also known as molecular biomarkers) include gene mutations and 
fusions.203 Testing for certain biomarkers is also recommended for eligible 
patients with resectable early-stage and locally advanced NSCLC (see 
Surgery Followed by Adjuvant Therapy in this Discussion). The panel 
defines broad molecular profiling for NSCLC as molecular testing that 
identifies all of the classic actionable biomarkers described in the 
algorithm [eg, ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2 (HER2), KRAS, METex14 
skipping, NTRK1/2/3, RET, ROS1]—using either a single assay or a 
combination of a limited number of assays—and optimally also identifies 
the emerging biomarkers (eg, high-level MET amplifications) (see 
Summary of the Guidelines Updates and Principles of Molecular and 
Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Tiered KRAS 
testing approaches based on the low prevalence of co-occurring
biomarkers, are acceptable (see KRAS Mutations in this Discussion).173,204 
Broad genomic profiling may be used to assess for mechanisms of 
resistance in patients who have had disease progression on targeted 
therapy. In addition, broad molecular profiling may be used to distinguish 
separate primary lung cancers from intrapulmonary metastases (see 
Multiple Lung Cancers in this Discussion). Broad genomic profiling may 
also help determine eligibility for certain molecularly driven clinical trials. 
The various testing methods that may be used to assess for the different 
biomarkers are described in the algorithm (see Principles of Molecular and 
Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Broad molecular 
profiling systems may be used to simultaneously test for multiple 
biomarkers. NGS (also known as massively parallel sequencing) is a type 
of broad molecular profiling system that can detect panels of mutations 
and gene fusions if the NGS platforms have been designed and validated 
to detect these somatic genomic alterations.205-213 It is important to 
recognize that NGS requires quality control as much as any other 
diagnostic technique; because it is design dependent, the panel of genes 
and abnormalities detected with NGS will vary depending on the design of 
the NGS platform. For example, some NGS platforms can detect both 
mutations and gene fusions, as well as copy number variation, but they 
are not uniformly present in all NGS assays being conducted either 
commercially or in institutional laboratories.  
Other mutation screening assays are available for detecting multiple 
biomarkers simultaneously, which can detect more than 50 point 
mutations; NGS platforms can detect even more biomarkers. However, 
multiplex PCR systems do not typically detect gene fusions. ROS1 and 
ALK gene rearrangements can be detected using fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH), NGS, and other methods (see Principles of Molecular 
and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).

=== PAGE 141 ===
To minimize tissue use and potential wastage, the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends that broad molecular profiling be done as part of biomarker 
testing using a validated test(s) that assesses a minimum of the following 
potential genetic variants: ALK rearrangements, BRAF mutations, EGFR 
mutations, ERBB2 (HER2) mutations, KRAS mutations, METex14 
skipping mutations, NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions, RET rearrangements, and 
ROS1 rearrangements. Both FDA and laboratory-developed test platforms 
are available that evaluate these and other analytes. Broad molecular 
profiling is also recommended to identify emerging biomarkers for which 
effective therapy may be available, such as high-level MET amplifications. 
Although clinicopathologic features—such as smoking status, ethnicity, 
and histology—are associated with specific somatic, disease-associated 
variants/mutations (eg, EGFR mutations), these features should not be 
used to select patients for testing. The NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC 
provide recommendations for individual biomarkers that should be tested 
and recommend testing techniques, but do not endorse any specific 
commercially available biomarker assays or commercial laboratories.  
Several systems are available to classify the pathogenicity of variants. 
One classification system uses 1) variants with strong clinical significance 
(Tier I); 2) variants with potential clinical significance (Tier II); 3) variants of 
unknown clinical significance (Tier III); and 4) variants that are benign or 
likely benign (Tier IV).111 Another classification system uses pathogenic, 
likely pathogenic, variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely not 
pathogenic (likely benign), and not pathogenic (benign); this schema is 
most commonly applied to germline alterations, with some adoption in 
somatic testing interpretation.214,215 Laboratories that adopt either 
approach (or others) typically do not report alterations that are classified 
as not pathogenic/Tier IV. Certain molecular testing methods—such as 
NGS or Sanger—can identify VUS alterations, while targeted assays 
generally do not detect them. The NCCN Guidelines note that any variant 
that is classified as VUS should not be used to select targeted therapy
even if the VUS occurs in a gene in which other variants are clinically 
actionable (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
ALK Gene Rearrangements  
About 5% of patients with NSCLC have ALK gene rearrangements.120 
Patients with ALK rearrangements are resistant to EGFR TKIs but have 
similar clinical characteristics to those with EGFR mutations, such as 
adenocarcinoma histology and either a light or never smoking history.216 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for ALK rearrangements in 
patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC based on data showing the 
efficacy of alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, or lorlatinib for ALK 
rearrangements and on FDA approvals.217-221 If patients appear to have 
squamous cell NSCLC, then ALK testing can be considered because ALK 
rearrangements also occur in squamous cell NSCLC, although at a lower 
rate than nonsquamous NSCLC.136,137 For the 2023 update (Version 1), 
the NCCN Panel now recommends testing for ALK rearrangements, in 
addition to EGFR mutations, in eligible patients with resectable 
early-stage NSCLC (stages IB–IIIA, stage IIIB [only T3,N2]) to assess 
whether adjuvant therapy with atezolizumab or pembrolizumab is an 
option. PD-L1 inhibitors are less beneficial in patients with some 
oncogenic drivers (ie, EGFR exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 21 L858R 
mutations, or ALK rearrangements).184  
The different testing methods for ALK rearrangements are described in the 
algorithm (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). A molecular diagnostic FISH test has 
been approved by the FDA for detecting ALK rearrangements. Rapid 
prescreening with IHC to assess for ALK rearrangements can be 
done.183,191,222-229 An IHC assay for ALK rearrangements has also been 
approved by the FDA. NGS can also be used to assess whether ALK 
rearrangements are present, if the platform has been appropriately
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 142 ===
designed and validated to detect ALK rearrangements.230-232 If an 
actionable oncogenic genetic variant occurs in a patient, usually only one 
variant is present.185,187-191,233,234 Therefore, tiered approaches may identify 
patients who will not benefit from further molecular testing (see KRAS 
Mutations in this Discussion).  
The NCCN Panel has preference stratified the first-line therapy options for 
patients with ALK rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC. Alectinib, 
brigatinib, or lorlatinib are recommended as preferred first-line 
monotherapy options for patients with ALK rearrangement–positive 
metastatic NSCLC (see NSCLC with ALK Rearrangements in this 
Discussion). Ceritinib is an “other recommended” option, whereas 
crizotinib is “useful in certain circumstances.” Data suggest that patients 
with ALK rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC do not respond to 
single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).184  
Patients typically have disease progression after first-line therapy with 
alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, or lorlatinib; subsequent therapy 
recommendations are described in the algorithm and often include 
continuing the first-line targeted therapies, depending on the type of 
progression [see Second-Line and Beyond (Subsequent) Systemic 
Therapy in this Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC]. Patients 
with ALK rearrangements often have brain metastases after progression 
on the initial targeted therapies. Treatment of limited brain lesions— 
clinical trials have included up to 3–5 progressing sites—in patients with 
NSCLC differs from that recommended in the NCCN Guidelines for 
Central Nervous System Cancers, because patients with NSCLC and 
brain lesions often have long-term survival; therefore, the potential 
neurocognitive issues that may occur with whole brain RT are a 
concern.235 Clinicians are using whole brain RT less often in patients with 
NSCLC and limited brain lesions.236 For multiple lesions, whole brain RT is 
recommended; stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may be preferred for 
patients who have good PS and low systemic tumor burden (see the 
NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers, available at 
www.NCCN.org).237-240 
BRAF V600E Mutations  
BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) is a 
serine/threonine kinase that is part of the MAP/ERK signaling pathway. 
The BRAF p.V600E mutation occurs in 1% to 2% of patients with lung 
adenocarcinoma; it is the most common of the BRAF point mutations 
when considered across all tumor types.188,241 Rare BRAF mutations 
include p.V600K, p.V600D, and other mutations. Patients with BRAF 
p.V600E mutations typically either currently or previously smoked 
cigarettes, whereas those with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements 
typically have never smoked.242 Mutations in BRAF typically do not overlap 
with EGFR mutations, METex14 skipping mutations, RET rearrangements, 
ALK rearrangements, or ROS1 rearrangements.188,189 Testing for BRAF 
mutations is recommended in patients with metastatic nonsquamous 
NSCLC. Testing may be considered in patients with metastatic NSCLC 
squamous cell carcinoma because BRAF mutations also occur in 
squamous cell NSCLC, although at a lower rate than nonsquamous 
NSCLC.136,137,188,189 Real-time PCR, Sanger sequencing, and NGS are the 
most commonly used methods to assess for BRAF mutations (see 
Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC).  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for BRAF mutations in 
patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC based on data showing the 
efficacy of dabrafenib plus trametinib for patients with BRAF p.V600E 
mutations and on FDA approval (see NSCLC with BRAF V600E Mutation 
in this Discussion).188 The NCCN Panel has preference stratified the 
first-line therapy options for patients with BRAF p.V600E mutation–positive 
metastatic NSCLC. Dabrafenib plus trametinib is a preferred treatment
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 143 ===
option for patients with BRAF p.V600E mutations. If combination therapy 
with dabrafenib plus trametinib is not tolerated, single-agent therapy with 
dabrafenib or vemurafenib are treatment options; therefore, these agents 
are categorized as “useful in certain circumstances.”188,189,243 
Chemotherapy regimens used for initial systemic therapy (eg, carboplatin 
plus paclitaxel) are also “useful in certain circumstances.” In patients with 
BRAF p.V600E mutation–positive metastatic NSCLC, the response rate is 
about 24% to single-agent ICIs.184 
EGFR Mutations  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for EGFR mutations, 
including common and uncommon mutations, in eligible patients with 
metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data as described in the following 
sections. Molecular testing for EGFR mutations is also recommended for 
eligible patients with resectable stage IB to IIIA and stage IIIB (only T3,N2) 
NSCLC to determine whether adjuvant therapy with osimertinib is an 
option (see Surgery Followed by Adjuvant Therapy: Trial Data and NCCN 
Recommendations in this Discussion).  
EGFR Exon 19 Deletions and EGFR Exon 21 L858R Mutations  
In patients with NSCLC, the two most commonly found EGFR gene 
mutations are deletions in exon 19 (with conserved deletion of the LREA 
sequence) in 45% of patients with EGFR mutations and a point mutation in 
exon 21 (L858R in 40%). Both mutations result in activation of the tyrosine 
kinase domain, and both are associated with sensitivity to the 
small-molecule EGFR TKIs, such as afatinib, dacomitinib, erlotinib, 
gefitinib, and osimertinib (see Targeted Therapies in this Discussion).244 
Because these EGFR mutations are sensitive to the EGFR TKIs, they 
were previously referred to as sensitizing EGFR mutations; however, the 
specific mutations are now described. These common EGFR mutations 
are found in approximately 10% of white patients with NSCLC and up to 
50% of Asian patients.245 Other less common mutations (approximately 
10%), which are also sensitive to EGFR TKIs, include exon 20 p.S768I, 
exon 21 p.L861Q, and/or exon 18 p.G719X (see EGFR S768I, L861Q, 
and G719X Mutations in this section and Principles of Molecular and 
Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).246,247 Data 
suggest that patients harboring tumors without these specific EGFR 
mutations should not be treated with EGFR TKIs in any line of therapy, 
although there are exceptions.  
Most patients with the common EGFR mutations have adenocarcinoma 
histology and either have never smoked cigarettes or previously lightly 
smoked. Data suggest that EGFR mutations can occur in patients with 
adenosquamous carcinoma, which is harder to discriminate from 
squamous cell carcinoma in small specimens.248 Patients with pure 
squamous cell carcinoma are less likely to have the common EGFR 
mutations; those with adenosquamous carcinoma may have 
mutations.136,137,248 However, smoking status, ethnicity, and histology 
should not be used in selecting patients for testing. The NCCN Panel 
recommends that molecular testing be considered in all patients with 
metastatic NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma because these patients 
may also have actionable biomarkers, such as EGFR mutations, 
although at a lower incidence than those with metastatic NSCLC 
adenocarcinoma.136,137,184,185  
The predictive effects of the EGFR exon 19 deletions and EGFR exon 21 
L858R mutations are well-defined. Patients with these common EGFR 
mutations have a significantly better response to afatinib, dacomitinib, 
erlotinib, gefitinib, or osimertinib.244 Data show that EGFR TKI therapy is 
as effective as first-line monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC 
and common EGFR mutations (see Targeted Therapies in this 
Discussion).249-254 Progression-free survival (PFS) is longer with use of 
EGFR TKI monotherapy in patients with the common EGFR mutations 
when compared with cytotoxic systemic therapy, although overall survival

is not statistically different for afatinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib.249,250,255,256 
Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are usually resistant to 
afatinib, dacomitinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib, although there are rare 
exceptions (eg, p.A763_Y764insFQEA) (see Principles of Molecular and 
Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).257-262 Patients 
typically have disease progression after first-line EGFR TKI monotherapy; 
subsequent therapy recommendations are described in the algorithm. The 
phrase subsequent therapy is used in these NCCN Guidelines instead of 
second-line or beyond therapy, because the line of therapy may vary 
depending on previous treatment with targeted agents. 
Most patients with the common EGFR mutations become resistant to 
afatinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib; PFS is about 9.7 to 13 months.250,256,263-265 
EGFR p.Thr790Met (T790M) is an EGFR exon 20 mutation that is 
associated with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy and has been 
reported in about 60% of patients with disease progression after initial 
response to afatinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib.210,265-271 Studies suggest T790M 
may rarely occur in patients who have not previously received afatinib, 
erlotinib, or gefitinib.272 Germline T790M confers a high risk for lung cancer 
regardless of smoking status.273-275 Therefore, genetic counseling is 
recommended for patients if p.T790M is identified before treatment. 
Acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs may also be associated with histologic 
transformation from NSCLC to SCLC and with epithelial to mesenchymal 
transition.276-280 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends that a tissue 
biopsy should be considered at progression to rule out SCLC 
transformation (approximately 6%) and to evaluate mechanisms of 
resistance.277 Acquired resistance can also be mediated by other 
molecular events, such as acquisition of ALK rearrangement, MET or 
ERBB2 amplification, and other biomarkers.281  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for EGFR mutations 
(category 1) and other biomarkers in patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC NOS based on data showing the 
efficacy of afatinib, dacomitinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, or osimertinib and on 
FDA approvals (see NSCLC with EGFR Alterations in this 
Discussion).18,249-254 Molecular testing can be considered for EGFR 
mutations and other biomarkers in patients with squamous cell carcinoma 
as previously described. 
DNA mutational analysis is used to assess for EGFR status; IHC is not 
recommended for detecting EGFR mutations.282-285 Real-time PCR, 
Sanger sequencing (paired with tumor enrichment), and NGS are the most 
commonly used methods to assess EGFR mutation status (see Principles 
of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).183,282 Direct sequencing of DNA corresponding to exons 18 to 21 
(or just testing for exons 19 and 21) is a reasonable approach; however, 
more sensitive methods are available.245,284,286-288 Mutation screening 
assays using multiplex PCR can simultaneously detect more than 50 point 
mutations.289 NGS is a preferred method for detecting EGFR variants, 
because targeted PCR approaches may miss some EGFR exon 20 
insertion mutations.212  
The NCCN Panel has preference stratified the first-line therapy options 
for patients with EGFR mutation-positive (exon 19 deletion, exon 21 
L858R) metastatic NSCLC. Osimertinib is a preferred first-line EGFR TKI 
option for patients with EGFR-positive metastatic NSCLC (see NSCLC 
with EGFR Alterations in this Discussion). Erlotinib (± bevacizumab or 
ramucirumab), afatinib, dacomitinib, or gefitinib are “other recommended” 
EGFR TKI options for first-line therapy. Osimertinib is recommended 
(category 1) as second-line and beyond (subsequent) therapy for patients 
with EGFR T790M–positive metastatic NSCLC and disease progression 
on erlotinib (± bevacizumab or ramucirumab), afatinib, dacomitinib, or 
gefitinib.264,290
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 145 ===
EGFR S768I, L861Q, and G719X Alterations 
Less common EGFR mutations (approximately 10%) that are also 
sensitive to first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR TKIs (eg, afatinib, 
erlotinib, gefitinib, osimertinib; classic EGFR TKIs) include exon 20 
p.S768I, exon 21 p.L861Q, and exon 18 p.G719X (see Principles of 
Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).246,247,255,291 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for 
EGFR S768I, L861Q, and G719X mutations in eligible patients with 
metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy of afatinib or 
osimertinib as preferred first-line therapy options for patients with EGFR 
S768I, L861Q, and G719X mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC (see 
NSCLC with EGFR Alterations in this Discussion).255,291 Other 
recommended TKI options in this setting include dacomitinib, erlotinib, or 
gefitinib.292,293 
EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations 
Exon 20 insertions are the third most common EGFR mutations; they 
occur in approximately 2% of patients with NSCLC and 4% to 12% of 
patients with EGFR mutations.179,259,294,295 Although there are many 
different EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, three are more common 
(insASV, insSVD, and insNPH).179 Most patients with EGFR exon 20 
insertion mutations have low response rates (≤9%) to afatinib, erlotinib, 
or gefitinib.178,179 An exception is the p.A763_Y764insFQEA mutation; 
afatinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib are effective for patients with this EGFR 
exon 20 insertion.257 When used at high doses (160 mg/day), osimertinib 
is associated with response rates of about 25% in patients with EGFR 
exon 20 insertion mutations, which is much lower than with EGFR exon 
19 deletions or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations.296 First-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy (± immunotherapy) is a recommended 
option for patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations (eg, carboplatin plus 
paclitaxel).297-299 Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations who 
receive first line platinum based chemotherapy have shorter median
overall survival (about 16 months) compared with patients with EGFR 
exon 19 deletions or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations who receive 
targeted therapy with afatinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib (about 39 
months).178,300,301 The response rates (0%–25%) to immunotherapy 
regimens vary, depending on the specific EGFR exon 20 insertion 
mutation.179,302,303  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for EGFR exon 20 
insertion mutations in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on 
data showing the efficacy of amivantamab-vmjw or mobocertinib as 
subsequent therapy options for patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion 
mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC and on FDA approvals (see NSCLC 
with EGFR Alterations in this Discussion).178,179 NGS is preferred for 
detecting EGFR exon 20 variants because PCR-based strategies may 
miss some variants (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in 
the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
ERBB2 (HER2) Mutations 
For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel added content about 
ERBB2 (HER2) mutations (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker 
Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). ERBB2 encodes for HER2, 
which is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is found on the surface of normal 
epithelial cells that is often overexpressed or mutated in various human 
malignancies, such as NSCLC. ERBB2 (HER2) alterations are commonly 
insertion or duplication events in exon 20 but other activating mutations 
are also observed. The panel added a caveat that while some ERBB2 
(HER2) mutations are known to be activating, not all single- or 
double-nucleotide changes are activating. ERBB2 (HER2) exon 20 
mutations occur in approximately 3% of patients (median age, 62 years) 
with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.304 Patients tend to be women who 
have never smoked cigarettes; they have a higher incidence of brain 
metastases than those with other actionable mutations. Although
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 146 ===
clinicopathologic features—such as smoking status and histology—are 
associated with ERBB2 (HER2) activating mutations, these features 
should not be used to select patients for testing. For the 2023 update 
(Version 1), the NCCN Panel added testing recommendations for ERBB2 
(HER2) mutations. NGS-based approaches are best able to survey the 
broad spectrum of genomic ERBB2 (HER2) alterations that may occur, 
although Sanger sequencing and targeted PCR approaches may also be 
used. The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for ERBB2 (HER2) 
mutations in all patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC 
NOS based on clinical trial data and FDA approval of fam-trastuzumab 
deruxtecan-nxki [see NSCLC with ERBB2 (HER2) Mutations in this 
Discussion]. Testing for ERBB2 (HER2) mutations can be considered in 
patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Resources are 
available to assess whether the ERBB2 (HER2) mutations are oncogenic 
or likely to be oncogenic (see oncoKB.org). Data suggest that patients with 
ERBB2 mutations respond to first-line immunotherapy regimens.306  
KRAS Mutations  
KRAS is a G-protein with GTPase activity that is part of the MAP/ERK 
pathway; point mutations in KRAS most commonly occur at codon 12. 
Approximately 25% of patients with adenocarcinomas in a North American 
population have KRAS mutations; KRAS is the most common mutation in 
this population.118,175,211,307,308 KRAS mutation prevalence is associated 
with cigarette smoking, unlike many of the other actionable mutations (eg, 
EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements).309 Patients with KRAS mutations 
appear to have a shorter survival than patients with wild-type KRAS; 
therefore, KRAS mutations are prognostic biomarkers.192,308,310 KRAS 
mutations do not generally overlap with EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, and ALK 
genetic variants.185,188-191,311 Therefore, a tiered approach using KRAS 
testing may identify patients who may not benefit from further molecular 
biomarker testing.173,204 KRAS mutations may infrequently overlap with 
EGFR mutations or RET rearrangements 312,313 In patients with KRAS
mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC, data suggest the response rate is 
about 26% for single-agent ICIs.184,314 First-line platinum-based 
chemotherapy (± immunotherapy) is a recommended option for patients 
with KRAS mutations (eg, carboplatin plus paclitaxel).  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for KRAS mutations in 
eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the 
efficacy of adagrasib or sotorasib as subsequent therapy options for 
patients with KRAS p.G12C mutations and on FDA approvals (see NSCLC 
with KRAS G12C Mutations in this Discussion).315-317 Responsiveness to 
adagrasib or sotorasib has not been assessed for mutations other than 
KRAS G12C. NGS, real-time PCR, and Sanger sequencing (ideally with 
tumor enrichment) are the most commonly used methods to assess for 
KRAS mutations (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in 
the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
MET Genomic Alterations  
C-MET, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, is a tyrosine kinase 
receptor that is involved in cell survival and proliferation; oncogenic driver 
genomic alterations in MET include METex14 skipping mutations, MET 
gene copy number (GCN) gain or amplification, and MET protein 
overexpression.187 MET genomic alterations do not typically overlap with 
EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, and ALK genetic variants.318 However, METex14 
skipping mutations and MET amplification may occur together. METex14 
skipping mutations occur in 3% to 4% of patients with adenocarcinoma 
NSCLC and 1% to 2% of patients with other NSCLC histologies.319,320 
METex14 skipping mutations are more frequent in older women who have 
never smoked cigarettes.321  
Several different types of METex14 skipping mutations may occur, such 
as mutations, base substitutions, and deletions, which makes it difficult to 
test for all of the mutations. NGS is the primary method of detecting METex14 skipping mutations; RNA based NGS may have improved

=== PAGE 147 ===
detection. IHC should not be used to detect METex14 skipping mutations. 
In patients with METex14 skipping mutation–positive metastatic NSCLC, 
data suggest the response rate is about 16% for single-agent ICIs, even 
with high PD-L1 levels.184,322 Data suggest that patients with MET 
amplification respond to immunotherapy.323 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for METex14 skipping 
mutations in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on data 
showing the efficacy of several agents for patients with METex14 skipping 
mutations and on FDA approvals for capmatinib and tepotinib (see NSCLC 
with MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutations in this Discussion).324,325 The NCCN 
Panel has preference stratified the first-line therapy options for patients 
with METex14 skipping mutation–positive metastatic NSCLC. The NCCN 
Panel voted that capmatinib or tepotinib are preferred first-line 
monotherapy options for patients with METex14 skipping mutation–
positive metastatic NSCLC. The panel also voted that crizotinib or 
systemic therapy options (such as carboplatin plus paclitaxel) are useful in 
certain circumstances. 
NTRK1/2/3 Gene Fusions 
NTRK gene fusions encode tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) fusion 
proteins (eg, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC) that act as oncogenic drivers for solid 
tumors including lung, salivary gland, thyroid, and sarcoma.326-328 A 
diverse range of solid tumors in children and adults may be caused by 
NTRK gene fusions (eg, NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3). It is estimated that 
NTRK1/2/3 fusions occur in 0.2% of patients with NSCLC and do not 
typically overlap with other oncogenic drivers such as EGFR, ALK, or 
ROS1.327 Various methods can be used to detect NTRK1/2/3 gene 
fusions, including NGS, FISH, IHC, and PCR assays (see Principles of 
Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). 
NGS testing can detect a broad range of NTRK gene fusions; however, 
RNA-based NGS may improve detection. DNA-based NGS may not detect 
some NTRK1 and NTRK3 fusions; RNA-based NGS may be considered to 
assess for fusions.329 In a clinical trial, NTRK gene fusions were detected 
with NGS (50 patients) and FISH (5 patients).328 Larotrectinib and 
entrectinib are oral TKIs that inhibit TRK across a diverse range of solid 
tumors in patients with NTRK gene–fusion positive disease, regardless of 
age.328,330  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends NTRK1/2/3 gene fusion testing in 
patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data showing the 
efficacy of larotrectinib or entrectinib for patients with NTRK gene fusion–
positive disease and on FDA approvals; however, clinical data are limited 
in NSCLC to support this recommendation (see NSCLC with NTRK Gene 
Fusion in this Discussion).328,331  
RET Rearrangements 
RET is a tyrosine kinase receptor that affects cell proliferation and 
differentiation. Rearrangements may occur in NSCLC between the RET 
gene and other domains, especially kinesin family 5B (KIF5B) and coiled 
coil domain containing-6 (CCDC6), which lead to overexpression of the 
RET protein.332,333 RET rearrangements occur in about 1% to 2% of 
patients with NSCLC and are more frequent in patients with 
adenocarcinoma histology.332-336 In European patients, RET 
rearrangements occur in individuals who currently smoke cigarettes and 
those who have never nonsmoked.334 RET rearrangements do not 
typically overlap with EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, METex14 skipping, and ALK 
genetic variants.333 However, a few studies suggest that RET 
rearrangements may infrequently overlap with EGFR or KRAS 
mutations.312,313 NGS, FISH, and RT-PCR can be used to detect RET 
rearrangements (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in 
the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).333 NGS has high specificity; however, 
RNA-based NGS is preferable to DNA-based NGS for fusion detection. In

patients with RET-positive metastatic NSCLC, data suggest the response 
rate is about 6% to single-agent ICIs.184  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for RET rearrangements in 
eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the 
efficacy of several agents for patients with RET rearrangements and on 
FDA approvals for selpercatinib and pralsetinib.337-340 Previously, the panel 
deleted vandetanib for patients with RET rearrangements because there 
are better therapy options.341,342 The NCCN Panel has preference stratified 
the therapy options for patients with RET rearrangement-positive 
metastatic NSCLC. The NCCN Panel voted that selpercatinib or 
pralsetinib are preferred monotherapy options for patients with RET 
rearrangement-positive metastatic NSCLC; cabozantinib is useful in 
certain circumstances.  
ROS1 Rearrangements  
Although ROS1 is a distinct receptor tyrosine kinase, it is very similar to 
ALK and members of the insulin receptor family.343,344 It is estimated that 
ROS1 gene rearrangements occur in about 1% to 2% of patients with 
NSCLC.344-347 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends ROS1 testing in 
patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC NOS based on 
data showing the efficacy of crizotinib, ceritinib, and entrectinib for 
patients with ROS1 rearrangements.190,344,348,349 ROS1 testing can be 
considered in patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC because 
ROS1 rearrangements also occur in metastatic squamous cell NSCLC, 
although at a lower rate than nonsquamous NSCLC.136,137 Various 
methods can be used to detect ROS1 rearrangements, including NGS, 
FISH, IHC, and PCR assays, although some methods are more effective 
(see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).222,344,346,349-353 False-negative results may occur 
with FISH, IHC, PCR and DNA-based NGS.354 RNA-based NGS may be 
considered to assess for fusions.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends crizotinib, entrectinib, or ceritinib 
as first-line monotherapy options for patients with ROS1-positive 
metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data (see NSCLC with ROS1 
Rearrangements in this Discussion). The NCCN Panel has preference 
stratified the first-line therapy options for patients with ROS1-positive 
metastatic NSCLC. The NCCN NSCLC Panel voted that crizotinib and 
entrectinib are preferred first-line therapy options for patients with 
ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC because they are better tolerated, 
have been assessed in more patients, and are approved by the 
FDA.330,348,349,355 Although entrectinib has better central nervous system 
(CNS) penetration than crizotinib, it is more toxic. The NCCN NSCLC 
Panel voted that ceritinib is an “other recommended” first-line therapy 
option for patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC. If ROS1 
rearrangements are discovered during first-line systemic therapy (eg, 
carboplatin plus paclitaxel), then the planned therapy may be either 
completed or interrupted followed by crizotinib (preferred), entrectinib 
(preferred), or ceritinib.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends lorlatinib as a subsequent therapy 
option for select patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC and 
disease progression after treatment with crizotinib, entrectinib, or ceritinib 
(see NSCLC with ROS1 Rearrangements in this Discussion).356 However, 
the panel clarified that entrectinib is recommended as a subsequent 
therapy option for patients with symptomatic brain lesions after 
progression on crizotinib or ceritinib.357 Initial systemic therapy options that 
are used for adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma are also an 
option in this setting (eg, carboplatin plus paclitaxel). In patients with 
ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC, data suggest the response rate is 
about 17% for single-agent ICIs.184 Local therapy may be considered for 
limited progression.

Testing for Immune Biomarkers 
PD-L1 Expression Levels  
Human ICI antibodies inhibit the PD-1 receptor or PD-L1, which improves 
antitumor immunity; PD-1 receptors are expressed on activated cytotoxic 
T cells.358-360 Cemiplimab-rwlc, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab inhibit 
PD-1 receptors.138,361,362 Atezolizumab and durvalumab inhibit PD-L1.363,364 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends IHC testing for PD-L1 expression 
(category 1) ideally before first-line treatment (if clinically feasible) in all 
patients with metastatic NSCLC to assess whether the ICI regimens are 
an option based on clinical data showing the efficacy of these regimens 
(see Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in this Discussion).138,365  
Although it is not an optimal biomarker, PD-L1 expression is currently the 
best available biomarker to assess whether patients are candidates for 
PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (also known as ICIs, immuno-oncology [IO] 
agents, immunotherapy).366,367 PD-L1 expression is continuously variable 
and dynamic; thus, a cutoff value for a positive result is artificial. Patients 
with PD-L1 expression levels just below and just above 50% will probably 
have similar responses.366 Unique anti-PD-L1 IHC assays have been 
developed for each one of the different ICIs.366,368-370 The definition of a 
positive or negative PD-L1 test result depends on the individual antibody, 
clone, and platform, which may be unique to each ICI.370 Extensive effort 
has been undertaken to examine the cross-comparability of different 
clones with regard to each other to facilitate adoption of testing. While 
some clones for PD-L1 are FDA-approved for specific indications, using 
multiple IHC tests is not necessary if the individual IHC test has been 
validated against the FDA-approved clone. Testing for PD-L1 is not 
required for prescribing first-line therapy with certain ICI regimens—such 
as cemiplimab-rwlc monotherapy or atezolizumab with or without 
chemotherapy—or for subsequent therapy with single-agent nivolumab or 
atezolizumab. 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel emphasizes that clinicians should obtain 
molecular testing results for actionable biomarkers before administering 
first-line ICI therapy, if clinically feasible, including ALK, BRAF, EGFR, 
ERBB2 (HER2), KRAS, METex14 skipping, NTRK1/2/3, RET, and ROS1 
variants. If it is not feasible to do molecular testing, then patients are 
treated as though they do not have driver oncogenes. Patients with 
metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 expression levels of 1% or more—but who 
also have a targetable driver oncogene molecular variant—should receive 
first-line targeted therapy for that oncogene and not first-line ICIs, because 
targeted therapies yield higher response rates (eg, osimertinib, 80%) than 
ICIs (lower response rates) in the first-line setting, targeted therapy is 
better tolerated, and these patients are less likely to respond to 
single-agent ICIs.184,371-374  
TMB  
TMB is an approximate measure of the total number of somatic 
mutations.375 Theoretically, high TMB levels will correlate with high 
neoantigen levels that will activate an antitumor immune response.376 TMB 
levels are typically high in patients with NSCLC who currently or previously 
smoked cigarettes. Low TMB is more commonly detected in individuals 
who have never smoked cigarettes.329,377 Preliminary data for PFS from 
CHECKMATE 227, a phase 3 randomized trial with a complex design, 
suggested that TMB might be a useful immune biomarker for deciding 
whether to use immunotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC.378 
However, updated data from CHECKMATE 227 showed that overall 
survival was improved with nivolumab plus ipilimumab regardless of TMB 
or PD-L1 expression levels.379 In addition, combining TMB with PD-L1 
expression level also did not correlate with overall survival. Several trials 
have shown that high TMB levels do not correlate with PD-L1 expression 
levels in patients with NSCLC.378-381 KEYNOTE 158, a phase 2 trial, 
assessed TMB levels in patients with solid tumors who received 
pembrolizumab as second-line therapy; however none of the patients had
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 150 ===
NSCLC.382 TMB does not identify patients who will respond to 
chemotherapy; therefore, TMB has limited value for assessing 
combination immunotherapy plus chemotherapy regimens.376 TMB is also 
not an ideal immune biomarker because some patients with low TMB 
levels respond to immunotherapy and others with high levels do not 
respond to immunotherapy.376  
In addition to the lack of clinical data to support use of TMB as an immune 
biomarker, there are technical problems with measuring TMB.375 These 
problems include: 1) lack of agreement on the definition of a cut off for 
designating high TMB levels; and 2) lack of standardization of TMB 
measurements across laboratories.375 PD-L1 expression level is a more 
useful immune biomarker than TMB for deciding how to use 
immunotherapy, because test results are obtained more quickly, less 
tissue is needed for testing, and data demonstrate relative reproducibility 
across platforms and individuals. In 2020, the NCCN Panel removed TMB 
as an emerging immune biomarker for patients with metastatic NSCLC 
based on clinical trial data, concerns about variable TMB measurements, 
and other issues as described here.171,375,379 The NCCN Guidelines do not 
recommend measurement of TMB levels before deciding whether to use 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab regimens or to use other ICIs, such as 
pembrolizumab.171 
Treatment Approaches  
Surgery, RT, and systemic therapy are the three modalities most 
commonly used to treat patients with NSCLC. They can be used either 
alone or in combination depending on the disease status. In the following 
sections, the clinical trials are described that have led to the 
recommended treatments. For tools to aid optimal assessment and care of 
older adults, see the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology (available 
at www.NCCN.org). Older adults may be at risk for treatment-related 
adverse events 383
Surgery 
In general, surgery provides the best chance for cure in patients with stage 
I or II disease.384 Thoracic surgical oncology consultation should be part of 
the evaluation of any patient being considered for curative local therapy. 
The overall plan of treatment and the necessary imaging studies should be 
determined before any nonemergency treatment is initiated. It is essential 
to determine whether patients can tolerate surgery or whether they are 
medically inoperable; some patients deemed inoperable may be able to 
tolerate minimally invasive surgery and/or sublobar resection.384-390 
Although frailty is an increasingly recognized predictor of surgical and 
other treatment morbidity, a preferred frailty assessment system has not 
been established.391-393  
The Principles of Surgical Therapy are described in the NSCLC algorithm 
and are summarized here. Determination of resectability, surgical staging, 
and pulmonary resection should be performed by thoracic surgeons who 
should participate in multidisciplinary clinics and/or tumor boards for 
patients with lung cancer. Surgery may be appropriate for select patients 
with uncommon types of lung cancer (eg, superior sulcus, chest wall 
involvement) (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).394 Patients with 
clinical stage IB or greater disease, or high-risk factors, should be referred 
to a medical oncologist for evaluation. For patients with stage IIIA NSCLC 
that is deemed resectable, consider referral to a radiation oncologist. 
Treatment delays, because of poor coordination among specialists, should 
be avoided.  
The surgical procedure used depends on the extent of disease and on the 
cardiopulmonary reserve of the patient. A preoperative or intraoperative 
tissue diagnosis of lung cancer should be established before doing a 
lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy. If a preoperative or 
intraoperative tissue diagnosis appears risky or unreliable, 
multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended to determine the safest and
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 151 ===
most efficient approach, or to provide consensus that a biopsy is too 
risky or difficult and that anatomic resection can occur without prior 
tissue confirmation of lung cancer.  
Lung-sparing anatomic resection (sleeve lobectomy [also known as sleeve 
resection]) is preferred over pneumonectomy, if anatomically appropriate 
and if margin-negative resection can be achieved; lobectomy or 
pneumonectomy should be done if physiologically feasible.384,395,396 
Sublobar resection, either segmentectomy (preferred) or wedge resection, 
is appropriate in select patients: 1) those who are not eligible for 
lobectomy; and 2) those with a peripheral nodule 2 cm or less with very 
low-risk features (see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).385,397-402 Segmentectomy (preferred) or wedge 
resection should achieve parenchymal resection margins that are: 1) 2 cm 
or more; or 2) the size of the nodule or larger. Resection (including wedge 
resection) is preferred over ablation.384,396 Wide wedge resection may 
improve outcomes.403  
Patients with medically inoperable early-stage NSCLC may be candidates 
for definitive RT, preferably SABR, also known as stereotactic body RT 
(SBRT).404,405 If SABR is considered for patients at high risk for surgical 
morbidity, a multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended (see Stereotactic 
Ablative Radiotherapy in this Discussion).404,406-408  
Lymph Node Dissection  
ACOSOG Z0030, a randomized phase 3 trial, compared systematic 
mediastinal lymph node sampling versus complete lymphadenectomy 
during pulmonary resection in patients with NSCLC who had either N0 (no 
demonstrable metastasis to regional lymph nodes) or N1 (metastasis to 
lymph nodes in the ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar region, including 
direct extension) disease. In patients with early-stage NSCLC who had 
negative nodes by systematic lymph node dissection, complete 
mediastinal lymph node dissection did not improve survial. Thus systematic lymph node sampling is appropriate during pulmonary 
resection; one or more nodes should be sampled from all mediastinal 
stations. For right-sided cancers, an adequate mediastinal 
lymphadenectomy should include stations 2R, 4R, 7, 8, and 9. For 
left-sided cancers, stations 4L, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 should be sampled.409 
Patients should have N1 and N2 node resection and mapping (American 
Thoracic Society map) with a minimum of three N2 stations sampled or a 
complete lymph node dissection.152 The lymph node map from the IASLC 
may be useful.411 Formal ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node dissection is 
indicated for patients undergoing resection for stage IIIA (N2) disease. For 
patients undergoing sublobar resection, the appropriate N1 and N2 lymph 
node stations should be sampled unless not technically feasible because 
sampling would substantially increase the surgical risk.  
Thoracoscopic Lobectomy  
Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), which is also known as 
thoracoscopic lobectomy, is a minimally invasive surgical treatment (see 
Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).412,413 
Published studies suggest that thoracoscopic lobectomy has several 
advantages over lobectomy by thoracotomy.414-418 Acute and chronic pain 
associated with thoracoscopic lobectomy is minimal; thus, this procedure 
requires a shorter length of hospitalization.419,420 Thoracoscopic lobectomy 
is also associated with low postoperative morbidity and mortality, minimal 
risk of intraoperative bleeding, or minimal locoregional recurrence.421-425 
Thoracoscopic lobectomy is associated with less morbidity, fewer 
complications, and more rapid return to function than lobectomy by 
thoracotomy.426-429  
In patients with stage I NSCLC who had thoracoscopic lobectomy with 
lymph node dissection, the 5-year survival rate, long-term survival, and 
local recurrence rate were comparable to those achieved by routine open 
lung resection.430-434 Thoracoscopic lobectomy has also been shown to
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 152 ===
improve discharge independence in older populations and patients at high 
risk.435,436 Data show that thoracoscopic lobectomy improves the ability of 
patients to complete postoperative chemotherapy regimens.437,438 Based 
on its favorable effects on postoperative recovery and morbidity, 
thoracoscopic lobectomy (including robotic-assisted approaches) is 
recommended in the NSCLC algorithm as an acceptable approach for 
patients who are surgically resectable (and have no anatomic or surgical 
contraindications) as long as principles of thoracic surgery are not 
compromised (see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC).439-442 Robotic VATS seems to be more expensive with longer 
operating times than conventional VATS.443,444  
Stage IIIA N2 Disease 
The role of surgery in patients with pathologically documented stage IIIA 
(N2) disease is described in the NSCLC algorithm (see Principles of 
Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC) and summarized 
here. Before treatment, it is essential to carefully evaluate for N2 disease 
using radiologic and invasive staging (ie, EBUS-guided procedures, 
mediastinoscopy, thoracoscopic procedures) and to discuss whether 
surgery is appropriate in a multidisciplinary team, which should include a 
thoracic surgeon.445,446 Randomized controlled trials suggest that surgery 
does not increase survival in these patients.447,448 However, one of these 
trials (EORTC) only enrolled patients with unresectable disease.448 Most 
clinicians agree that resection is appropriate for patients with negative 
preoperative mediastinal nodes and with a single positive node (<3 cm) 
found at thoracotomy.449 Neoadjuvant (also known as preoperative or 
induction) systemic therapy is recommended for select patients with 
resectable NSCLC (see Combined Modality Therapy in this Discussion).  
The optimal timing of RT in trimodality therapy (preoperative with 
chemotherapy or postoperative) is not established and is 
controversial.450-452 Adding RT to induction regimens for patients with 
stage IIIA (N2) disease has been associated with higher pathological 
response but similar overall survival when compared with using 
preoperative chemotherapy (generally followed by postoperative RT).452 
For patients with completely resected stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC who 
received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, data from the LungART 
and PORT-C trials show that postoperative RT (also known as PORT) 
did not improve survival compared with no postoperative RT, although 
locoregional control was significantly improved.450,453 Postoperative RT 
may be considered for select patients with negative margins and 
high-risk N2 disease (see Chemoradiation in this Discussion and 
Principles of Radiation Therapy in the algorithm). It is controversial 
whether pneumonectomy after preoperative chemoradiotherapy is 
appropriate.447,454-460 Clinicians also agree that resection is not 
appropriate for patients with multiple pathologically proven malignant 
lymph nodes greater than 3 cm; definitive chemoradiotherapy is 
recommended for these patients. Patients with resectable stage IIIA (N2) 
disease should not be excluded from surgery, because some of them 
may have long-term survival or may be cured.455,461  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel believes that surgery may be appropriate for 
select patients with N2 disease.445,455,462 The NCCN Member Institutions 
were surveyed in 2021 regarding their approach to patients with N2 
disease (see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). For example, more institutions now use neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with 
N2 disease. Many (66%) of the NCCN Member Institutions use induction 
chemotherapy, whereas 33% use induction chemoradiation.463,464 Before 
surgery, most institutions require at least stable disease after induction 
therapy but do not require radiologic or pathologic response. All NCCN 
institutions consider surgery for single-station non-bulky N2 disease. 
However, 50% consider surgery for single-station bulky disease, 39% for 
multi-station non-bulky disease and 21% for multi-station bulky disease

Radiation Therapy  
The Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NSCLC algorithm include the 
following: 1) general principles for early-stage, locally advanced, and 
advanced/metastatic NSCLC; 2) target volumes, prescription doses, and 
normal tissue dose constraints for early-stage, locally advanced, and 
advanced/metastatic NSCLC; and 3) RT simulation, planning, and 
delivery.465-475 These RT principles are summarized in this section. Whole 
brain RT and SRS for brain metastases are also discussed in this section. 
The RT abbreviations are defined in the NSCLC algorithm (see Table 1 in 
Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). For 
the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel revised some of the 
RT recommendations in the algorithm (see Summary of the Guidelines 
Updates and Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). For example, recommendations about postoperative RT have 
been revised based on clinical trial data.450,453,471-475  
General Principles 
Treatment recommendations should be made by a multidisciplinary team. 
Because RT has a potential role in all stages of NSCLC, as either 
definitive or palliative therapy, input from radiation oncologists who 
perform lung cancer RT as a prominent part of their practice should be 
part of the multidisciplinary evaluation for all patients with NSCLC. RT 
recommendations for NSCLC include: 1) definitive therapy for locally 
advanced NSCLC, generally combined with chemotherapy; 2) definitive 
therapy for early-stage NSCLC in patients with contraindications for 
surgery; 3) neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy (also known as preoperative 
or postoperative therapy) for selected patients treated with surgery; 4) 
therapy for limited progression; and/or 5) palliative therapy for patients 
with incurable NSCLC.408,450,453,476-483 The goals of RT are to maximize 
tumor control and to minimize treatment toxicity. Advanced technologies 
such as 4D-CT simulation, intensity-modulated RT/volumetric modulated 
arc therapy (IMRT/VMAT) image guided RT (IGRT) motion management
strategies, and proton therapy have been shown to reduce toxicity and 
increase survival in nonrandomized trials.472,484-490 A secondary analysis of 
the RTOG 0617 randomized trial reported that 2-year overall survival, 
PFS, local failure, and distant metastasis-free survival were not 
significantly different for IMRT when compared with older 3D-conformal 
RT (3D-CRT) technique despite higher tumor burden in patients treated 
with IMRT. However, IMRT yielded lower rates of severe pneumonitis 
compared with 3D-CRT (3.5% vs. 7.9%; P = .039).491 CT-planned 3D-CRT 
is now considered to be the minimum technological standard, with IMRT 
preferred.  
Radiation Simulation, Planning, and Delivery  
Simulation should be performed using CT scans obtained in the RT 
treatment position. Intravenous contrast CT scans, with or without oral 
contrast, are recommended for better target delineation whenever 
possible, especially in patients with central tumors or nodal involvement. 
FDG PET/CT can significantly improve target delineation accuracy, 
especially when there is atelectasis or contraindications to intravenous CT 
contrast.492,493 Ideally, target delineation should be based on PET/CT that 
is obtained no more than 4 weeks before treatment because of the 
potential for rapid progression of NSCLC.494,495 In the NSCLC algorithm, 
recommendations are provided for patients receiving chemoradiation 
(including those with compromised lung or cardiac function), photon 
beams, or IMRT (see the Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).489,496-499 Respiratory motion should be managed. 
The report from the AAPM Task Group 76 is a useful reference for 
implementing a broad range of motion management strategies as 
described in the NSCLC algorithm.500  
Target Volumes, Prescription Doses, and Normal Tissue Dose Constraints  
Commonly used prescription RT (or SABR) doses and normal tissue dose 
constraints are summarized in the Principles of Radiation Therapy in the
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 154 ===
NSCLC algorithm (see Tables 2–5 in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).466,468,480,501-506 Reports 50, 62, and 83 from the International 
Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements provide a formalism 
for defining RT target volumes based on grossly visible disease, potential 
microscopic extension, and margins for target motion and daily positioning 
uncertainty;507,508 the ACR Practice Parameters and Technical Standards 
are also a helpful reference.486,509,510 It is essential to evaluate the 
dose-volume histogram (DVH) of critical structures and to limit the doses 
to the organs at risk (such as spinal cord, lungs, heart, esophagus, and 
brachial plexus) to minimize normal tissue toxicity (see Table 5 in 
Principles of Radiation Therapy).511 For patients receiving postoperative 
RT (also known as PORT), stricter DVH parameters should be considered 
for the lungs. The QUANTEC review provides the most comprehensive 
estimates from clinical data of dose-response relationships for normal 
tissue complications.512-516  
The normal tissue dose constraints for conventionally fractionated RT are 
based on a survey of radiation oncologists at NCCN Member Institutions 
(see Table 5 in Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC).473,517-522 These constraints are mainly empirical and have not, 
for the most part, been validated rigorously.501,521,523-528 Therefore, the 
doses and constraints provided in the tables are not specific prescriptive 
recommendations; they are useful reference doses that have been 
commonly used or are from previous clinical trials. A caveat was also 
added that these constraints represent doses that generally should not be 
exceeded. Because the risk of toxicity increases progressively with dose 
to normal tissues, a key principle of radiation treatment planning is to keep 
normal tissue doses "as low as reasonably achievable" while adequately 
covering the target. The doses to any given organ at risk should typically 
be lower than these constraints, approaching them only when there is 
close proximity to the target volume. After surgery, lung tolerance to RT is 
much less than for patients with intact lungs; therefore, more conservative 
constraints should be used for postoperative RT.  
For definitive RT, the commonly prescribed dose is 60 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy 
fractions over 6 to 7 weeks (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).529,530 RTOG 0617, a phase 3 randomized 
trial, suggests that high-dose radiation using 74 Gy with concurrent 
chemotherapy does not improve survival, and might be harmful, when 
compared with a dose of 60 Gy.518,531-535 In this trial and subsequent 
retrospective analyses, higher dose to the heart and specific cardiac 
substructures, such as the coronary arteries, was associated with 
increased mortality.535-541 Although optimal RT dose intensification remains 
a valid question, the NCCN Panel does not currently recommend a high 
dose of 74 Gy for routine use.532,534,535,537-545  
General Treatment Information 
The RT recommendations for patients with stages I to IV are described in 
the NSCLC algorithm (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Definitive RT, preferably SABR, is recommended 
for patients with early-stage NSCLC (ie, stage I–II, N0) who are medically 
inoperable or those who refuse surgery (see Stereotactic Ablative 
Radiotherapy in this Discussion).404,405,408,483,546,547 SABR is also an option 
for patients at high surgical risk who cannot tolerate a lobectomy because 
of a major medical comorbidity and/or severely limited lung function. After 
definitive RT (preferably SABR), adjuvant chemotherapy may be 
considered in patients with high-risk factors for recurrence (eg, large tumor 
size), similar to the postoperative setting.406,548-550 Image-guided thermal 
ablation (eg, cryotherapy, microwave, radiofrequency ablation [RFA]) is an 
option for selected patients who are medically inoperable and will not 
receive SABR or definitive RT (see Principles of Image-Guided Thermal 
Ablation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).384,551-557 Resection 
is recommended for patients with early-stage NSCLC who are medically fit

(see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).558 The indications for using preoperative or postoperative 
chemoradiation, systemic therapy, or RT alone are described in the 
NSCLC algorithm (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). In patients with clinical stage I or II NSCLC who 
are upstaged to N2+ after surgery, postoperative chemotherapy can be 
administered, with concurrent postoperative RT for patients with positive 
margins, or followed by postoperative RT in selected patients with 
high-risk features.  
Definitive chemoradiation is recommended for patients with stage II to III 
disease who are not appropriate surgical candidates.559 For patients with 
locally advanced NSCLC (stage III), the most commonly prescribed 
conventionally fractionated doses for definitive RT are 60 to 70 Gy in 2 
Gy fractions. Doses of at least 60 Gy should be given.560 Involved-field 
RT (also known as involved-field irradiation or IFI) is recommended for 
treating nodal disease in patients with locally advanced NSCLC (over the 
older standard of elective nodal irradiation, or ENI).561-568  
The optimal care of patients with potentially operable stage IIIA (N2) 
NSCLC is controversial and is discussed in detail in the algorithm (see 
Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).445,447,452,459,569 Before surgical resection of stage IIIA NSCLC, 
induction systemic therapy or induction chemoradiotherapy is 
recommended to potentially shrink the tumor(s).452,463 Preoperative 
systemic therapy and postoperative RT is an option for patients with 
resectable stage IIIA NSCLC with minimal N2 disease who can be 
treated with lobectomy.451,464 Preoperative concurrent chemoradiation is 
recommended for resectable superior sulcus tumors and is an option for 
other resectable stage IIA to IIIA NSCLC.503 In a 2021 survey of the 
NCCN Member Institutions, we found that 66% use induction 
chemotherapy, whereas 33% use induction chemoradiation before surgery 
for patients with stage IIIA N2 disease.463,464 The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends a preoperative RT dose of 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy 
fractions over 5 weeks.451,570 Definitive RT doses delivered as 
preoperative chemo/RT can safely be administered and achieve 
promising nodal clearance and survival rates;504-506,571 the risk of surgical 
complications after high-dose RT can be minimized with expert thoracic 
surgical techniques. About 50% of NCCN Member Institutions would 
consider pneumonectomy after preoperative chemotherapy, whereas 
only 25% do not consider pneumonectomy absolutely contraindicated 
after preoperative induction chemoradiation.  
Surgery is associated with potentially greater risk of complications, 
particularly stump breakdown and bronchopleural fistula, in a field that 
has had high-dose RT (eg, 60 Gy). Thus, surgeons are often wary of 
resection in areas that have previously received RT doses of more than 
45 to 50 Gy, especially in patients who have received definitive doses of 
preoperative concurrent chemoradiation (ie, ≥60 Gy). Soft tissue flap 
coverage and reduced intraoperative fluid administration and ventilator 
pressures can reduce the risk of these complications.504-506 When giving 
preoperative RT to less than definitive doses (eg, 45 Gy), one should be 
prepared up front to continue to a full definitive dose of RT without 
interruption if the patient does not proceed to surgery for some reason. 
For these reasons, when considering trimodality therapy, the treatment 
plan—including assessment for resectability and the type of resection—
should be decided before initiation of any therapy. In postoperative RT, 
the clinical target volume (CTV) includes the bronchial stump and 
high-risk draining lymph node stations.572 Standard RT doses after 
complete resection are 50 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions over 5 to 6 
weeks, but a boost may be considered to high-risk regions including 
areas of nodal extracapsular extension or microscopic positive 
margins.467,573,574 Lung dose constraints should be more conservative, 
because tolerance appears to be reduced after surgery. The LungART

and PORT-C trials provide useful guidelines for postoperative RT 
technique.450,453,575 Highly conformal techniques (such as IMRT or proton 
therapy) to minimize lung and heart doses are preferred.  
For patients with advanced lung cancer (ie, stage IV) with extensive 
metastases, systemic therapy is recommended; palliative RT can be 
used for symptom relief and potentially for prophylaxis at primary or 
distant sites (such as pain, bleeding, or obstruction) (see Therapy for 
Recurrence and Metastases in the algorithm).483,576-578 Shorter courses of 
palliative RT are preferred for patients with symptomatic chest disease 
who have poor PS and/or shorter life expectancy (eg, 17 Gy in 8.5 Gy 
fractions in 1–2 weeks), because they provide similar pain relief as 
longer courses, although there is a higher potential need for retreatment 
(see Table 4 in the Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).579-582 Higher dose and longer course thoracic RT 
(eg, ≥30 Gy in 10 fractions) are associated with modestly improved 
survival and symptoms, especially in patients with good PS.576,583 When 
higher doses (>30 Gy) are warranted, technologies to reduce normal 
tissue irradiation may be used (at least 3D-CRT and including IMRT or 
proton therapy as appropriate).  
Oligometastatic disease is heterogenous and refers to limited metastatic 
sites or disease burden; management is evolving. Definitive local therapy 
to oligometastases (including brain and lung) achieves prolonged survival 
in a small proportion of well-selected patients with PS 0 to 2 who have 
also received radical therapy to the intrathoracic disease.584 Definitive RT 
to oligometastases, particularly SABR, is an appropriate option in such 
cases if it can be delivered safely to the involved sites.585,586 In two 
randomized phase II trials, significantly longer PFS was found for local 
consolidative therapy (RT or surgery) to primary and oligometastatic 
lesions versus maintenance systemic therapy or observation for patients 
not progressing on systemic therapy.587,588 Updated data from one of the 
trials also show that median overall survival was longer for patients with 
oligometastatic NSCLC who received local consolidative therapy (median, 
41.2 months; 95% CI, 18.9 months–not reached) compared with those 
receiving maintenance therapy or observation (median, 17.0 months; 95% 
CI, 10.1–39.8 months; P = .017).589 A phase 2 trial of consolidative RT for 
oligometastatic NSCLC (n = 29) reported median overall survival of 
28.4 months (95% CI, 14.5–45.8 months).590 The NCCN Guidelines 
recommend that local therapy (RT, SABR, or surgery) to primary and 
oligometastatic lesions should be considered for patients without 
progression on systemic therapy.587-589  
Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy  
SABR (also known as SBRT) uses short courses of highly conformal and 
dose-intensive (ablative) RT precisely delivered to limited-size 
targets.404,591-594 SABR has achieved good primary tumor control rates 
and overall survival that is higher than conventionally fractionated RT.404 
Studies, including prospective multi-institutional trials, have 
demonstrated the efficacy of SABR for patients with inoperable stage I 
NSCLC or for those who refuse surgery.408,595-599 With conventionally 
fractionated RT, 3-year survival is only about 20% to 35% in these 
patients, with local failure rates of about 40% to 60%.405 In prospective 
clinical trials, local control and overall survival appear to be considerably 
increased with SABR, generally more than 85%, and about 60% at 3 
years (median survival, 4 years), respectively, in patients who are 
medically inoperable.384,405,499,557,558,598,600-605 A 7-year follow-up of 65 
patients with medically inoperable stage I NSCLC reported that overall 
survival rates were 55.7% at 5 years and 47.5% at 7 years.546 In 12 
patients (18.5%), a second primary lung carcinoma developed after 
SABR at a median of 35 months (range, 5–67 months); 27% (18/65) had 
disease recurrence a median of 14.5 months (range, 4.3–71.5 months) 
after SABR.

=== PAGE 157 ===
Although SABR is not proven equivalent to lobectomy for patients with 
operable early-stage NSCLC, some prospective series have shown 
similar overall survival and cancer-specific survival.471,595,597,606 A 
combined analysis of two randomized trials (that individually did not 
complete accrual) compared SABR to lobectomy, with 3-year overall 
survival of 95% and 79%, respectively.606 A single-arm SABR expansion 
cohort of one of the trials with longer follow-up compared non-randomly 
to a propensity-matched contemporary cohort treated with VATS 
lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection and found 5-year 
overall survival of 87% and 84%, respectively.471 These analyses do not 
provide sufficient data to change the standard of care for good surgical 
candidates but help to confirm the indication for SABR in patients with 
relative contraindications to surgery or those who refuse surgery. SABR 
can also be used for patients with limited lung metastases or limited 
metastases to other body sites.592,599,607-613  
SABR is recommended in the NSCLC algorithm for patients with stage I 
and II (T1–3,N0,M0) NSCLC who are medically inoperable; SABR is a 
reasonable alternative to surgery for patients with potentially operable 
disease who are high risk, older, or refuse surgery after appropriate 
consultation (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).384,599,601,606,614 If 
possible, biopsy should confirm NSCLC before use of SABR.404,615,616 
Decisions about whether to recommend SABR should be based on 
multidisciplinary discussion. If therapy is contemplated based on a 
clinical diagnosis without tissue confirmation of NSCLC, then 
multidisciplinary evaluation is required to provide consensus on the 
risk-benefit ratio of biopsy and/or the clinical diagnosis.617,618 By analogy 
with surgical treatment, adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered after 
definitive RT, preferably SABR, in patients with high-risk factors for 
recurrence (eg, large tumor size).406,548-550  
Locoregional recurrences can occur after SABR.558,597,619-624 Late 
recurrences have been reported more than 5 years after SABR, 
highlighting the need for careful surveillance.625,626 After SABR, 
assessment of recurrences by imaging can be challenging because of 
benign inflammatory/fibrotic changes that can remain FDG-PET avid for 2 
or more years after treatment, emphasizing the importance of follow-up by 
a team with experience interpreting such post-treatment effects.627,628 This 
careful follow-up is particularly relevant, because selected patients with 
recurrences after SABR may benefit from surgery or re-treatment with 
SABR.625,629-633  
SABR fractionation regimens and a limited subset of historically used 
maximum dose constraints are provided in the NSCLC algorithm; 1 to 5 
fractions are generally used (see Tables 2 and 3 in the Principles of 
Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).404,596,598,605,634-644 
In the United States, only regimens of 5 fractions or less meet the arbitrary 
billing code definition for SBRT; however, slightly more protracted ablative 
regimens are also appropriate.644,645 Prescription doses do not completely 
describe the actual delivered doses.646,647 These maximum dose 
constraints are for reference and are not intended to be prescriptive; they 
are used commonly or have been used in clinical trials. Although none of 
these dose constraints has been validated as a maximally tolerated dose, 
outcomes of clinical trials to date suggest that they are safe constraints. 
The bronchial tree, esophagus, and brachial plexus are critical structures 
for SABR. For centrally located tumors—defined variably as within 2 cm of 
the proximal bronchial tree and/or abutting mediastinal pleura—regimens 
of 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions are not safe and should be avoided; 4- to 
10-fraction SABR regimens appear to be effective and safe (see Principles 
of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).406,637,648-650 The 
RTOG 0813 trial evaluated 5-fraction regimens and found no high-grade 
toxicities at 50 Gy in 5 fractions.651,652

SRS or SABR for limited oligometastases to the brain or other body sites, 
respectively, is recommended for patients with good PS if their thoracic 
disease can be treated with definitive therapy (see Stage IVA, M1b in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).394,585,586,599,653-656 SRS or SABR can be 
considered for select patients with stage M1c disease who have limited 
metastases that are amenable to treatment with definitive local therapy; 
clinical trials have included up to 3 to 5 metastatic sites.653,654 For patients 
with disease progression on targeted therapy for ALK rearrangements, 
ROS1 rearrangements, or the common EGFR mutations (ie, exon 19 
deletion or exon 21 L858R), consideration of local therapy (eg, surgery or 
SABR [or SRS]) is recommended for limited progression.657-660 
Hypofractionated or dose-intensified conventional 3D-CRT is a less 
preferred option if an established SABR program is not available.661-663 
Nonrandomized clinical data indicate that local tumor control with SABR is 
higher than with image-guided thermal ablation techniques. Image-guided 
thermal ablation (ie, cryotherapy, microwave, radiofrequency) may be an 
option for selected patients who will not be receiving SABR or definitive 
RT.384,408,557  
Whole Brain RT and Stereotactic Radiosurgery 
Many patients with NSCLC have brain metastases (30%–50%), which 
substantially affect their quality of life.664,665 Control of brain metastases 
preserves neurocognitive function.666,667 However, whole brain RT is 
itself associated with measurable declines in neurocognitive function in 
clinical trials, particularly with increasing dose and advanced age of the 
patient.668-670 For limited brain metastases, randomized trials have found 
that the addition of whole brain RT to SRS decreases intracranial 
recurrence but does not improve survival and may increase the risk of 
cognitive decline.667,671 Thus, SRS alone is recommended for patients 
with limited brain metastases.237 A randomized trial assessed cognitive 
function in 213 patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases who received SRS 
alone versus SRS with whole brain RT; most patients had lung cancer 236
At 3 months after SRS alone, patients had less cognitive deterioration 
(40/63 patients [63.5%]) than those receiving SRS plus whole brain RT 
(44/48 patients [91.7%]; difference, -28.2%; 90% CI, -41.9% to -14.4%; 
P < .001). Resection followed by SRS to the cavity (instead of resection 
followed by whole brain RT) may decrease the risk of neurocognitive 
impairment.672,673 A randomized trial demonstrated that using IMRT to 
avoid the hippocampus decreases memory impairment after whole brain 
RT.674 A phase 3 randomized trial assessed optimal supportive care 
(including dexamethasone) with whole brain RT versus optimal 
supportive care alone in patients with NSCLC and brain metastases who 
were not eligible for brain surgery or SRS.675 Overall survival was similar 
between the groups (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90–1.26). Overall quality of life, 
use of dexamethasone, and reported adverse events were also similar 
between the arms. Two retrospective analyses have reported increased 
survival in patients with brain metastases who received SRS and 
concurrent ICI therapy.676,677  
Treatment options for limited brain metastases in patients with NSCLC 
include: 1) SRS alone; and 2) surgical resection for selected patients 
followed by SRS or whole brain RT (see the NCCN Guidelines for Central 
Nervous System Cancers, available at www.NCCN.org). Selected 
patients include those with symptomatic lesions or whose tumor tissue is 
needed for diagnosis.236,610,665,678-684 Decisions about whether to 
recommend SRS alone or brain surgery followed by whole brain RT or 
SRS for limited brain metastases should be based on multidisciplinary 
discussion, weighing the potential benefit over the risk for each individual 
patient.678,685-687 Treatment should be individualized for patients with 
recurrent or progressive brain lesions.688 For extensive brain metastases, 
whole brain RT (with hippocampal avoidance if eligible) and memantine 
are recommended (see the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous 
System Cancers, available at www.NCCN.org).237-240

Combined Modality Therapy  
As previously mentioned, surgery provides the best chance for cure for 
patients with stage I or II disease who are medically fit and can tolerate 
surgery. SABR can be considered for patients with medically inoperable or 
high-risk stage I or II (T1–3,N0) disease or those who refuse surgery if 
their disease is node negative (see Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in 
this Discussion and see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). In patients with 
completely resected NSCLC, adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy has 
been shown to improve survival in patients with early-stage disease.689-692 
Some studies suggest that preoperative chemotherapy (also referred to as 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy or induction chemotherapy) is as effective as 
and better tolerated than postoperative chemotherapy (see Preoperative 
Chemotherapy With or Without Immunotherapy Followed by Surgery in 
this Discussion).445,693-699 A randomized trial found no difference in survival 
with preoperative versus postoperative chemotherapy.700 The NCCN 
Guidelines state that patients with stage II or IIIA (T3,N1) disease may be 
treated with induction systemic therapy before surgery if they would have 
been candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.384,701 
Concurrent chemoradiation is more efficacious than sequential 
chemoradiation for patients with unresectable stage III disease.702-705 
Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents can cause hair loss, which is 
distressing for patients. Hair loss varies depending on the systemic 
regimen and other factors. Data in women with non-metastatic breast 
cancer suggest that a scalp cooling device may help reduce hair loss in 
patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens.706-710  
For patients with stage IV disease who have a good PS, platinum-based 
chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy is beneficial.711-718 Data 
show that early palliative care combined with systemic therapy improved 
quality of life, mood, and survival in patients with metastatic NSCLC, even 
if these patients had less aggressive end-of-life care, when compared with

treatment for debilitating symptoms.664,721,722 A study also suggests that 
social support, such as being married, is as effective as systemic 
therapy.723 Data suggest that systematic symptom monitoring during 
outpatient chemotherapy treatment increases overall survival when 
compared with usual care.724-726 Surgery is rarely recommended for 
patients with stage IV disease. However, surgical resection of limited brain 
progression may improve survival in selected patients with stage IV 
disease and is recommended for selected patients in the NCCN 
Guidelines (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).727 Definitive local 
therapy with surgical resection or RT is recommended for limited 
single-organ progression located in sites other than the brain if definitive 
thoracic therapy is feasible (see Stage IVA, M1b in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC).394,584,587,589,599,653,654 The trials supporting the 
recommendations for combined modality therapy are discussed in the 
following sections.  
Surgery Followed by Adjuvant Therapy 
Chemotherapy 
The International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT) assessed 
cisplatin-based postoperative therapy in patients with completely resected 
stage I, II, or III NSCLC.690 The study included 1867 patients with 
surgically resected lung cancer who were randomly assigned either to 
cisplatin-based postoperative chemotherapy or to observation, with a 
median follow-up duration of 56 months. The survival rate at 5 years was 
45% for cisplatin-based therapy versus 40% for observation (HR for death, 
0.86; 95% CI, 0.76–0.98; P < .03); the disease-free survival rate was 39% 
versus 34% at 5 years (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.94; P < .003). However, 
after 7.5 years of follow-up, there were more deaths in the chemotherapy 
group and the benefit of chemotherapy decreased over time.728 Data show 
that postoperative chemotherapy prevents recurrences.

The NCIC CTG JBR.10 trial and the ANITA trial compared the 
effectiveness of postoperative vinorelbine plus cisplatin versus observation 
in early-stage NSCLC. In the JBR.10 trial, 482 patients (ECOG PS of 0–1) 
with completely resected stage IB (T2a,N0) or stage II (T1,N1, or T2,N1) 
NSCLC were randomly assigned either to vinorelbine plus cisplatin or to 
observation.691 Postoperative chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall 
survival compared with observation alone (94 vs. 73 months; HR for 
death, 0.69; P = .04) and relapse-free survival (not reached vs. 47 months, 
HR for recurrence, 0.60; P < .001). The 5-year survival rates were 69% 
and 54%, respectively (P = .03). When compared with observation alone, 
postoperative chemotherapy was beneficial for patients with stage II 
disease but not for stage IB disease as shown by updated data from 
JBR.10 after 9 years of follow-up.729 In patients with stage II disease 
receiving postoperative chemotherapy, median survival was 6.8 versus 3.6 
years in those who were only observed. Of note, patients receiving 
chemotherapy did not have an increased death rate.  
In the ANITA trial, 840 patients with stage IB (T2a,N0), II, or IIIA NSCLC 
were randomly assigned either to postoperative vinorelbine plus cisplatin 
or to observation.692 Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were manageable in the 
chemotherapy group; seven toxic deaths were reported. After a median 
follow-up of 76 months, median survival was 66 months in the 
chemotherapy group and 44 months in the observation group.692 
Postoperative chemotherapy significantly improved (8.6%) the 5-year 
overall survival in patients with completely resected stage II and IIIA 
disease, although no benefit was observed in stage I. Some clinicians 
consider vinorelbine plus cisplatin to be the preferred regimen for 
completely resected early-stage NSCLC based on the number of trials and 
the amount of use;730 however, most clinicians in the United States prefer 
to use regimens with less toxicity.731,732  
A meta-analysis of 4584 patients (LACE) found that postoperative 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy increased survival over 5 years (absolute 
benefit of 5.4%); there was no difference among the chemotherapy 
regimens (vinorelbine, etoposide, and others).733 A subgroup analysis 
found that cisplatin plus vinorelbine also increased survival.730 The benefit 
was greater in patients with stage II and III disease and with good PS. 
Postoperative chemotherapy benefited older patients up to 80 years of 
age.389,734  
The CALGB 9633 trial assessed paclitaxel plus carboplatin in patients with 
stage IB (T2a,N0,M0) lung cancer.735-737 In this trial, 344 patients were 
randomly assigned either to paclitaxel plus carboplatin or to observation 
(within 4–8 weeks of resection) with a median follow-up duration of 74 
months. Postoperative chemotherapy was well tolerated with no 
chemotherapy-related toxic deaths. Overall survival at 6 years was not 
significantly different (however, a subset analysis showed a benefit for 
tumors ≥4 cm), although 3-year survival was significant (80% vs. 73%, 
P=.02).736,737 Thus, the carboplatin and paclitaxel regimen is only 
recommended for early-stage disease if patients cannot tolerate cisplatin 
(see Perioperative Systemic Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).738 It is important to note that the CALGB trial was underpowered 
for patients with stage 1B disease.739  
TREAT, a phase 2 randomized study, assessed cisplatin plus pemetrexed 
versus cisplatin plus vinorelbine as postoperative therapy for patients with 
completely resected stages IB to III NSCLC.731 Data showed that cisplatin 
plus pemetrexed was an effective, less toxic regimen compared with 
cisplatin plus vinorelbine; in addition, patients were able to receive more 
cycles of cisplatin plus pemetrexed compared with cisplatin plus 
vinorelbine.731 Overall survival at 3 years was similar between the arms 
(75% vs. 77%; P = .858).740

The NCCN NSCLC Panel does not recommend postoperative 
chemotherapy for resected stage IA disease based on the trials described 
in the previous paragraphs.741 Postoperative chemotherapy is 
recommended for high-risk, margin-negative, stage IB disease. 
Recommended chemotherapy regimens for preoperative and 
postoperative (perioperative) chemotherapy for patients with completely 
resected stages IB to III NSCLC are provided in the NCCN Guidelines; the 
regimens also include specific dosing (see Perioperative Systemic 
Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).689,741  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel has preference stratified all the systemic 
therapy regimens and decided that cisplatin plus pemetrexed is the 
preferred neoadjuvant or adjuvant option for nonsquamous NSCLC if 
patients are not candidates for ICIs (see Perioperative Systemic Therapy 
in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).731,740 Cisplatin plus gemcitabine or 
cisplatin plus docetaxel are the preferred perioperative chemotherapy 
options for patients with squamous cell NSCLC.742,743 Other recommended 
options include cisplatin plus vinorelbine or cisplatin plus etoposide.690-692 
Perioperative therapy options for patients who are not candidates for 
cisplatin-based therapy are preference stratified as useful in certain 
circumstances and include: 1) carboplatin plus paclitaxel; 2) carboplatin 
plus gemcitabine; and 3) carboplatin plus pemetrexed (but only for 
nonsquamous NSCLC).744-747 Neoadjuvant therapy is also known as 
preoperative (or induction) therapy; adjuvant therapy is also known as 
postoperative therapy.  
Targeted Therapy 
ADAURA, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed adjuvant therapy with 
osimertinib versus placebo in 682 patients with resected stage IB to IIIA 
EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.748 At 24 months, 89% (95% CI, 85%–
92%) of the osimertinib group and 52% (95% CI, 46%–58%) of the 
placebo group were alive and disease-free (overall HR for disease 
recurrence or death, 0.20; 99.12% CI, 0.14–0.30; P < .001). At 24 months, 
98% (95% CI, 95%–99%) of the osimertinib group and 85% (95% CI, 
80%–89%) of the placebo group were alive and did not have CNS disease 
(overall HR for disease recurrence or death, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.10–0.33). For 
patients with stage IB NSCLC, 88% (95% CI, 78%–94%) of the osimertinib 
group and 71% (95% CI, 60%–80%) of the placebo group were alive and 
disease-free at 24 months (overall HR for disease recurrence or death, 
0.39; 95% CI, 0.18–0.76). For patients with stage II NSCLC, 91% (95% CI, 
82%–95%) of the osimertinib group and 56% (95% CI, 45%–65%) of the 
placebo group were alive and disease-free at 24 months (overall HR, 0.17; 
95% CI, 0.08–0.31). For those with stage IIIA NSCLC, 88% (95% CI, 
79%–94%) of the osimertinib group and 32% (95% CI, 23%–41%) of the 
placebo group were alive and disease-free at 24 months (overall HR, 0.12; 
95% CI, 0.07–0.20). Data were also reported for those who received 
adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not; 60% (410/682) of patients 
received adjuvant chemotherapy.749 Overall survival data are not yet 
available. Serious adverse events were reported in 16% (54/339) of 
patients receiving osimertinib versus 12% (42/343) receiving placebo. Ten 
patients (3%) receiving osimertinib had interstitial lung disease versus no 
patients in the placebo group. There were no deaths in the osimertinib 
group versus one in the placebo group.  
The NCCN Panel recommends osimertinib as an adjuvant therapy option 
for eligible patients with completely resected (R0) stage IB to IIIA, and 
stage IIIB (only T3,N2) EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who have 
previously received adjuvant chemotherapy or are ineligible to receive 
platinum-based chemotherapy based on clinical trial data and FDA 
approval.748 Osimertinib is recommended in this setting for EGFR exon 19 
deletions or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, which are the most common 
EGFR mutations. Although it is technically easier to use a resected 
specimen to do molecular testing, it is also acceptable to use initial 
diagnostic biopsy specimens For the 2023 update (Version 1) the NCCN

Panel expanded the criteria to include patients with stage IIIB (only T3,N2) 
NSCLC based on differences between the AJCC staging systems for the 
7th and 8Th editions (see Table 3 in the algorithm).159 Although the 8th 
edition of the AJCC staging manual is currently being used, the clinical 
trial used the 7th edition. 
Immunotherapy 
Trial Data 
IMpower010, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed adjuvant therapy with 
atezolizumab versus best supportive care in 1005 patients with resected 
early-stage NSCLC and various PD-L1 levels who had received adjuvant 
chemotherapy.750 In patients with resected stage II to IIIA NSCLC and 
PD-L1 of 1% or more, disease-free survival was improved in those 
receiving adjuvant atezolizumab compared with best supportive care (HR, 
0.66; 95% CI, 0.5–0.88; P = .0039). Treatment-related grade 3 and 4 
adverse events were reported in 11% (53/495) of patients; 4 deaths 
occurred (1%, 4/495). Atezolizumab is an ICI that inhibits PD-L1 receptors. 
PEARLS/KEYNOTE 091, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed adjuvant 
therapy with pembrolizumab versus placebo in 1177 patients with 
completely resected stage IB to IIIA NSCLC (based on AJCC 7th 
edition).751 Most patients (86%) received adjuvant platinum-based 
chemotherapy after resection but had not received neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In patients who received adjuvant 
chemotherapy after resection, the median disease-free survival was 53.6 
months (95% CI, 39.2–not reached) in those receiving adjuvant 
pembrolizumab compared with 42.0 months (95% CI, 31.3–not reached) in 
those receiving placebo (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.91). Grade 3 or worse 
events included hypertension (6%) and pneumonia (2%). In patients 
receiving pembrolizumab, there were four fatal (1%) treatment-related 
adverse reactions, including myocarditis and cardiogenic shock, septic 
shock and myocarditis, pneumonia, and sudden death. Pembrolizumab is 
an ICI that inhibits PD-1 receptors.  
NCCN Recommendations 
The NCCN Panel recommends atezolizumab as an adjuvant therapy 
option for eligible patients with completely resected (R0) stage IIB to IIIA, 
stage IIIB (only T3,N2), or high-risk stage IIA NSCLC and with PD-L1 of 
1% or more who are negative for certain biomarkers—EGFR exon 19 
deletions, EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, and ALK rearrangements—
and who have previously received adjuvant chemotherapy based on 
clinical trial data and FDA approval.750 For the 2023 update (Version 2), 
the NCCN Panel added a recommendation for adjuvant pembrolizumab 
for eligible patients with completely resected stage IIB to IIIA, stage IIIB 
(only T3,N2), or high-risk stage IIA NSCLC who are negative for EGFR 
exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, or ALK fusions and 
who have previously received adjuvant chemotherapy.751 The panel added 
a caveat that the benefit of adjuvant pembrolizumab is unclear for patients 
with PD-L1 levels less than 1%. 
For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel expanded the 
molecular testing criteria to include ALK rearrangements because patients 
with ALK rearrangements, EGFR exon 19 deletions, or EGFR exon 21 
L858R mutations have less benefit from ICIs.184 Clinical trials are 
assessing whether ALK inhibitors are effective in this setting.752-758 The 
NSCLC Panel also clarified that single-agent therapy with osimertinib is 
recommended if patients have both EGFR mutations and PD-L1 of 1% or 
more; the panel does not recommend using single-agent therapy with 
atezolizumab or combination therapy with osimertinib plus atezolizumab in 
this setting. The NCCN Panel also added a recommendation that patients 
should be evaluated for perioperative (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) therapy 
before surgery. For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel

expanded the criteria to include patients with stage IIIB (only T3,N2) 
disease as previously described.  
Preoperative Chemotherapy With or Without Immunotherapy 
Followed by Surgery 
Trial Data 
Data from clinical trials in patients with resected NSCLCs indicate that 
delivery of chemotherapy is an important problem. In the postoperative 
setting, significant comorbidities and incomplete recovery after surgery 
often make it difficult for patients to tolerate systemic therapy. This 
problem was demonstrated in NATCH, a phase 3 randomized trial—which 
compared surgery alone to preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy 
with paclitaxel/carboplatin—because 90% of the preoperative cohort 
completed 3 cycles of chemotherapy but only 61% of the postoperative 
cohort completed chemotherapy; however, survival was equivalent among 
all three arms.698 IFCT 0002, a randomized trial, found no difference in 
3-year overall survival (67.4% vs. 67.7%) with preoperative versus 
postoperative chemotherapy in patients with early-stage NSCLC; 
response rate and quality of life were similar in both arms.700  
Several trials suggest that preoperative therapy is beneficial in patients 
with N2 disease.445,452,697 Other trials suggest that preoperative therapy is 
beneficial in patients with earlier stage disease.694,695,699 A randomized 
intergroup trial (SWOG 9900) evaluated preoperative paclitaxel plus 
carboplatin in 354 patients with stage IB to IIIA (but not N2) disease 
versus surgery alone. The trial closed prematurely because of practice 
changes and was therefore not appropriately powered. This SWOG trial 
did show a trend toward improved PFS (33 vs. 20 months) and overall 
survival (62 vs. 41 months) with preoperative chemotherapy, and no 
difference in resection rates between the two arms.699  
Scagliotti et al published a phase 3 trial of preoperative cisplatin plus 
gemcitabine versus surgery alone in 270 patients with stage IB to IIIA 
disease. Although the trial closed early, a significant survival benefit was 
seen in patients with stages IIB and IIIA disease who received 
preoperative chemotherapy (HR, 0.63).694 Song et al published a 
meta-analysis of 13 randomized clinical trials evaluating preoperative 
chemotherapy followed by surgery versus surgery alone in resectable 
NSCLCs (overall survival: HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77–0.92; P = .0001).693 
These results are similar to those reported in another meta-analysis (HR, 
0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98; P = .02).694 The benefit from preoperative 
chemotherapy is similar to that attained with postoperative 
chemotherapy.694,698,700,733  
CheckMate 816, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed neoadjuvant 
therapy with nivolumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy versus 
chemotherapy alone in 358 patients with resectable (tumors ≥4 cm or 
node positive) NSCLC (stage IB–IIIA resectable NSCLC using AJCC 
staging, 7th edition).107 Chemotherapy regimens included 1) cisplatin plus 
either pemetrexed (nonsquamous only) or gemcitabine (squamous only); 
or 2) carboplatin plus paclitaxel (any histology). If their patients could not 
tolerate cisplatin, clinicians could substitute carboplatin-based regimens. 
Patients had good PS (0–1) and did not have EGFR or ALK alterations. 
The median event-free survival was 31.6 months (95% CI, 30.2–not 
reached) for nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus 20.8 months (95% CI, 
14.0–26.7) for chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.63; 97% CI, 0.43–0.91; 
P=.005). The pathologic complete response was 24% (95% CI, 18%–
31%) with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus 2.2% (95% CI, 0.6%–
5.6%) with chemotherapy alone (odds ratio 13.9; 99% CI, 3.49–55.7; 
P<.001). The major pathologic response was 36.9% with nivolumab plus 
chemotherapy versus 8.9% with chemotherapy alone (major pathologic 
response, ≤10% viable tumor in lung and lymph nodes). The overall 
response rate was 53.6% for nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus 37.4%

=== PAGE 164 ===
with chemotherapy alone. Surgery was done for 83% of patients receiving 
nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus 75% of those receiving 
chemotherapy alone. Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events 
occurred in 33.5% of patients receiving nivolumab plus chemotherapy 
versus 36.9% of those receiving chemotherapy alone.  
NADIM, a single-arm phase 2 study, assessed neoadjuvant therapy with 
nivolumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin in 46 patients with surgically 
resectable stage IIIA NSCLC; 41 patients had resection.759,760 At 36 
months, updated results show that overall survival was 81.9% (95% CI, 
66.8%–90.6%).759 TMB and PD-L1 levels were not predictive of survival. 
Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 30% (14/46) of patients 
including increased lipase (3/46, 7%) and febrile neutropenia (3/46, 7%). 
None of the adverse events were associated with death or delays in 
surgery.  
NCCN Recommendations 
Based on clinical trial data, the NCCN Panel recommends that certain 
patients who are likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy may instead be 
treated with preoperative (also known as induction or neoadjuvant) 
systemic therapy after surgical evaluation.694,698,700,733 The NCCN Panel 
recommends nivolumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy as a 
neoadjuvant systemic therapy option for eligible patients with resectable 
(tumors ≥4 cm or node positive) NSCLC and no contraindications to 
treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors based on clinical trial data and FDA 
approval.107,760 For the 2023 update (Version 1), the panel added a 
recommendation that all patients should be evaluated for neoadjuvant 
therapy with strong consideration for those with node-positive disease or 
tumors 4 cm or more and no contraindications for ICIs. However, 
neoadjuvant therapy should not be used to attempt to induce 
resectability in patients who do not already meet criteria for resectability 
on initial evaluation. Some oncogenic drivers—such as EGFR exon 19 
deletions, EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, or ALK rearrangements—
have been shown to be associated with less benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 
inhibitors.184 Testing for PD-L1 status, EGFR mutations, and ALK 
rearrangements is recommended before administering neoadjuvant 
nivolumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy in eligible patients with 
stage IB (only tumors = 4 cm) to IIIA, or stage IIIB (only T3, N2) NSCLC. 
For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel expanded the criteria 
to include patients with stage IIIB (only T3,N2) NSCLC as previously 
described. The chemotherapy regimens that may be used with 
neoadjuvant nivolumab include: 1) cisplatin plus either pemetrexed 
(nonsquamous only), gemcitabine (squamous only), or paclitaxel (any 
histology); or 2) carboplatin plus either pemetrexed (nonsquamous only), 
gemcitabine (squamous only), or paclitaxel (any histology).107  
Chemoradiation 
The major controversies in NSCLC relate to the care of patients with stage 
IIIA disease (see the Role of Surgery in Patients with Stage IIIA (N2) 
NSCLC in Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). All three treatment modalities—surgical resection, 
chemotherapy, and radiation—may be used when treating stage III 
disease. The ongoing debate centers on which modalities to use and in 
what sequence.761-766  
Two randomized trials assessed postoperative RT in patients with clinical 
stage I or II disease that was upstaged surgically to N2.450,453 LungART, a 
phase 3 randomized trial, assessed postoperative RT versus no 
postoperative RT in 501 patients with completely resected stage IIIA (N2) 
NSCLC who had received either neoadjuvant (14%) or adjuvant 
chemotherapy (75%).450 The median disease-free survival was 30.5 
months (95% CI, 24–49) in the postoperative RT group versus 22.8 
months (95% CI, 17–37) in the control group (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.68–
1.08; P = .18). Common grade 3 to 4 adverse events included pneumonitis
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 165 ===
(postoperative RT: 5% [13/241]; control: <1% [1/246]); lymphopenia 
(postoperative RT: 4% [9/241]; control: 0); and fatigue (postoperative RT: 
3% [6/241]; control: <1%). Late-grade 3 to 4 cardiopulmonary toxicity 
occurred in 11% (26/241) of patients in the postoperative RT group versus 
5% (12/246) in the control group. Three patients died in the postoperative 
RT group (2, pneumonitis; 1, sepsis).  
PORT-C, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed postoperative RT versus 
no postoperative RT in 394 patients with completely resected stage IIIA 
(N2) NSCLC who had received adjuvant chemotherapy.453 The 3-year 
disease-free survival rates were 40.5% with postoperative RT versus 
32.7% with no RT (median, 22.1 vs. 18.6 months) (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 
0.65–1.09; P = .20). The 3-year overall survival rates were 78.3% in 
patients receiving postoperative RT versus 82.8% with no RT (HR, 
1.02; P = .93). The 3-year local recurrence only rates were 9.5% and 
18.3%, respectively (Fine-Gray HR, 0.55; Gray test P = .04). No 
radiotherapy-related grade 4 or 5 adverse events were reported.  
Data from the LungART and PORT-C trials show that postoperative RT 
(also known as PORT) did not improve survival compared with no 
postoperative RT, although locoregional control was significantly 
improved.450,453 For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel clarified 
that postoperative RT may be considered for select patients with high-risk 
N2 disease such as extracapsular extension, multi-station involvement, 
inadequate lymph node dissection or sampling, and/or refusal of or 
intolerance to adjuvant systemic therapy.450,453,761,767 To minimize 
potential lung and heart toxicities, highly conformal RT techniques such 
as IMRT or proton therapy are preferred.466,530,768,769  
For patients with unresectable stage IIIA or stage IIIB disease, combined 
modality therapy (chemoradiation) is more efficacious than RT 
alone.762,763,765,766,770 Concurrent chemoradiation is more efficacious than 
sequential chemoradiation. However, concurrent chemoradiation has a higher rate of grade 3 or 4 esophagitis than sequential 
chemoradiation. Selection of patients should be based not only on the 
anticipated response to therapy but also on how well the patient is 
anticipated to tolerate therapy. Accelerated RT regimens may be useful if 
concurrent chemoradiation would not be tolerated.772,773 Sequential 
chemoradiation or RT alone is recommended for frail patients who cannot 
tolerate concurrent chemoradiation.387,774  
JCOG0301, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed chemoradiation using 
low-dose carboplatin versus RT alone in patients (>70 years) with 
unresectable NSCLC.775 Median overall survival was 22.4 months (95% 
CI, 16.5–33.6) for chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin and 16.9 months 
(95% CI, 13.4–20.3) for RT alone (HR, 0.68; 95.4% CI, 0.47–0.98; 
P=.0179). In the chemoradiation group, 3% (3/100) of patients died, 
whereas 4% (4/100) of patients died in the RT group. Grade 3 to 4 
hematologic effects occurred at a greater rate in the chemoradiation arm 
than in the RT alone arm, including leucopenia (61 [63.5%] vs. none), 
neutropenia (55 [57.3%] vs. none), and thrombocytopenia (28 [29.2%] vs. 
2 [2.0%]). In older patients receiving chemoradiation versus RT alone, 
long-term follow-up data for overall survival continue to support using 
chemoradiation (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55–0.99; P = .024).776 Although the 
optimal sequence is not established, postoperative RT is generally 
administered after adjuvant chemotherapy or concurrently for positive 
resection margins.466,468,469,768 
Concurrent chemoradiation regimens recommended for all histologies for 
initial treatment include 1) cisplatin plus etoposide; and 2) carboplatin plus 
paclitaxel (see Concurrent Chemoradiation Regimens in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).532,702,704,777-782 For nonsquamous NSCLC, 
additional recommended concurrent chemoradiation regimens include 
pemetrexed plus either carboplatin or cisplatin.783-785 A weekly paclitaxel 
plus carboplatin regimen is another chemoradiation option.532 The different

=== PAGE 166 ===
options for preoperative, definitive, and postoperative chemotherapy/RT 
are described in detail in the algorithm. The NCCN NSCLC Panel has 
preference stratified all the systemic therapy regimens and decided that 
the following concurrent chemoradiation options are preferred for 
patients with NSCLC: 1) pemetrexed plus either carboplatin or cisplatin 
for nonsquamous NSCLC only; 2) carboplatin plus paclitaxel for all 
histologies; and 3) cisplatin plus etoposide for all histologies. The 
cisplatin plus vinblastine concurrent regimen is rarely used in the United 
States; therefore, it is not recommended in the NCCN Guidelines.  
The recommended sequential chemoradiation options include cisplatin 
combined with pemetrexed (nonsquamous only), docetaxel, etoposide, 
gemcitabine, or vinorelbine. Carboplatin regimens are recommended for 
patients with comorbidities or those not able to tolerate cisplatin, 
including 1) carboplatin plus gemcitabine; 2) carboplatin plus paclitaxel; 
and 3) carboplatin plus pemetrexed (nonsquamous only). The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel has preference stratified all the systemic therapy regimens 
and decided that the following sequential chemoradiation options are 
preferred for patients with NSCLC: 1) pemetrexed plus cisplatin for 
nonsquamous NSCLC only; 2) cisplatin plus gemcitabine for squamous 
histology; and 3) cisplatin plus docetaxel for squamous histology.  
Durvalumab  
Durvalumab is a human ICI antibody that inhibits PD-L1 (see PD-L1 
Expression Levels and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in this 
Discussion).358-360,363 PACIFIC, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared 
adjuvant treatment with durvalumab (also known as consolidation 
immunotherapy in this setting) versus placebo in eligible patients with 
unresectable stage III NSCLC (PS 0–1) but without disease progression 
after treatment with 2 or more cycles of definitive concurrent 
platinum-based chemoradiation.363,786 Eligible patients received adjuvant 
durvalumab after treatment with concurrent chemoradiation (1–42 days). 
Most patients either currently or previously smoked cigarettes and did 
not have EGFR mutations; their PD-L1 status was typically less than 
25% or unknown. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred at a similar rate 
in both groups of patients (durvalumab, 30.5% vs. placebo, 26.1%). 
Pneumonia was the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event 
(durvalumab, 4.4% vs. placebo, 3.8%). Durvalumab did not compromise 
patient-reported outcomes.787 An updated analysis of this trial reported 
that overall survival was increased after durvalumab consolidation (47.5 
months; 95% CI, 38.4–52.6) compared with placebo (29.1 months; 95% 
CI, 22.1–35.1) (stratified HR for death, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.45–0.68).16,786 
After 5 years, 42.9% of patients who received durvalumab were alive 
versus 33.4% of those who received placebo.13 In addition, 42.9% were 
alive after 5 years if they had received durvalumab and 33% were alive 
and free of disease progression compared with 19% of those who 
received placebo. The subgroup analyses were limited by small sample 
size and were not powered to assess efficacy. Patients receiving 
durvalumab received less subsequent immunotherapy (11.6%) 
compared with those who received placebo (28.3%).  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends durvalumab (category 1) as a 
consolidation immunotherapy option (regardless of PD-L1 status) for 
eligible patients (PS 0–1) with unresectable stage III NSCLC and without 
disease progression after treatment with definitive concurrent 
platinum-based chemoradiation based on this trial and FDA approval.363,786 
It is important to note that durvalumab is used as an adjuvant treatment 
option in this setting; it is not used as second-line therapy. Durvalumab 
may be used as a consolidation immunotherapy option after treatment with 
any of the concurrent chemoradiation regimens described in the algorithm 
(eg, cisplatin plus etoposide, carboplatin plus paclitaxel) (see Concurrent 
Chemoradiation Regimens in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Ten 
patients with stage II NSCLC were included in the PACIFIC trial, which 
used the older AJCC staging criteria (7th edition) Therefore the NCCN
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 167 ===
NSCLC Panel also recommends durvalumab as a consolidation 
immunotherapy option (regardless of PD-L1 status) for eligible patients 
(PS 0–1) with unresectable stage II NSCLC and without disease 
progression after treatment with definitive concurrent platinum-based 
chemoradiation.  
A few of the recommended concurrent chemoradiation regimens have an 
option for additional cycles (2 or 4) of chemotherapy after radiation, which 
is termed consolidation chemotherapy (see Concurrent Chemoradiation 
Regimens in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).503,532,778,783 If patients will 
be receiving durvalumab, the NCCN NSCLC Panel does not recommend 
consolidation chemotherapy based on concerns that adding consolidation 
chemotherapy will increase the risk of pneumonitis if patients are also 
receiving durvalumab. Durvalumab should be discontinued for patients 
with severe or life-threatening pneumonitis and should be withheld or 
discontinued for other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated 
adverse events when indicated (see prescribing information). If patients 
will not be receiving durvalumab because of medical contraindications or 
other reasons, consolidation chemotherapy is an option after concurrent 
chemoradiation, depending on the initial regimen.  
Systemic Therapy 
Chemotherapy 
Patients with metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC (who have a good PS) benefit 
from chemotherapy, usually with a platinum-based regimen, which was the 
only treatment option for many years before the advent of targeted therapy 
and immunotherapy regimens.715-717 If patients are not eligible for the 
targeted therapy or immunotherapy regimens, then chemotherapy 
regimens are recommended. Combination chemotherapy regimens 
produce 1-year survival rates of 30% to 40% and are more efficacious 
than single agents.738,743,788-790 However, survival rates are higher for 
patients with stage IV NSCLC who are eligible for either the newer
targeted therapy or immunotherapy regimens.9,14-27 Phase 3 randomized 
trials have shown that many of the platinum-doublet combinations yield 
similar objective response rates and survival.791,792 The platinum-doublet 
regimens differ slightly for toxicity, convenience, and cost; thus, clinicians 
can individualize therapy for their patients.743,793-799 Non–platinum-based 
regimens are also options, such as 1) gemcitabine plus vinorelbine, or 2) 
gemcitabine plus docetaxel.800-803 The prognosis for stage IV inoperable 
lung cancer remains poor if patients are not candidates for targeted 
therapy or immunotherapy regimens.  
In the United States, frequently used initial cytotoxic regimens for stage IV 
nonsquamous NSCLC include: 1) cisplatin (or carboplatin) plus 
pemetrexed; or 2) carboplatin plus paclitaxel with (or without) 
bevacizumab.777,804,805 Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (or carboplatin) is often 
used for patients with stage IV squamous cell NSCLC.790,795,804,805 These 
chemotherapy regimens are recommended based on phase 3 randomized 
trials (see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).790,806 A phase 3 randomized trial suggests 
that conventional cytotoxic agents should not be continued beyond 4 to 6 
cycles of therapy; however, many patients assigned to a longer duration of 
therapy did not receive the planned number of cycles (see Maintenance 
Therapy in this Discussion).807,808  
A phase 3 randomized trial assessed cisplatin plus pemetrexed versus 
cisplatin plus gemcitabine as first-line therapy in patients with stage IIIB or 
IV NSCLC.790 For patients with adenocarcinoma who received cisplatin 
plus pemetrexed, median overall survival was 12.6 months compared with 
10.9 months for those receiving cisplatin plus gemcitabine (HR, 0.84; 95% 
CI, 0.71–0.99; P = .03). In contrast, for patients with squamous cell 
NSCLC who received cisplatin plus pemetrexed, overall survival was 9.4 
versus 10.8 months for those receiving cisplatin plus gemcitabine (HR, 
1.23; 95% CI, 1.00–1.51; P = .05). Patients with nonsquamous NSCLC
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 168 ===
receiving cisplatin plus pemetrexed had less toxicity when compared with 
those receiving cisplatin plus gemcitabine.809 Median overall survival was 
similar for both regimens when histologies were combined (8.6 vs. 9.2 
months, respectively; HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.81–1.45; P = .586).  
TAX 326, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed docetaxel plus cisplatin 
(or carboplatin) versus vinorelbine plus cisplatin as first-line therapy for 
patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.743 Docetaxel plus cisplatin was 
associated with similar overall survival (11.3 vs. 10.1 months; P = .044; 
HR, 1.183; 97.2% CI, 0.989–1.416) and better response rate (31.6%) 
when compared with cisplatin plus vinorelbine (24.5%; P = .029); 
docetaxel plus cisplatin was associated with better quality of life and was 
better tolerated.  
Many oncologists use pemetrexed-based regimens for stage IV 
adenocarcinomas (if patients are not candidates for targeted therapy or 
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors), because taxane-based regimens are associated 
with more toxicity (eg, neurotoxicity).790,810 There are no agents for the 
prevention of peripheral neuropathy, and few agents are useful for 
treatment.811 The POINTBREAK trial showed that carboplatin plus 
pemetrexed plus bevacizumab is a reasonable option for patients with 
metastatic NSCLC and confirmed that taxane-based regimens are more 
toxic than pemetrexed-based regimens.812 The POINTBREAK trial also 
showed that both regimens are similar in regard to overall survival rates; 
therefore, oncologists may return to using taxane-based regimens, which 
are well established. A retrospective cohort study suggests that the 
addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin plus paclitaxel does not increase 
survival in patients ≥ 65 years with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.813 
However, another retrospective cohort study reported increased survival in 
older patients.814 A combined analysis of the ECOG 4599 and 
POINTBREAK trials found a survival benefit with the addition of 
bevacizumab to carboplatin plus paclitaxel in patients < 75 years but no 
benefit in those > 75 years.815 
Albumin-bound paclitaxel (also known as nab-paclitaxel) can be 
substituted for paclitaxel or docetaxel for patients: 1) who have 
experienced hypersensitivity reactions after receiving paclitaxel or 
docetaxel despite premedication; or 2) in whom premedications (ie, 
dexamethasone, H2 blockers, H1 blockers) to prevent hypersensitivity are 
contraindicated.816,817 A phase 3 randomized trial in patients with 
advanced NSCLC reported that an albumin-bound paclitaxel plus 
carboplatin regimen is associated with less neurotoxicity and improved 
response rate, when compared with the control arm of paclitaxel plus 
carboplatin.818 Based on the trial and FDA approval, the NCCN NSCLC 
Panel recommends an albumin-bound paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimen 
as initial cytotoxic therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC and good 
PS.  
Chemotherapy is recommended for patients with stage IV NSCLC and 
negative test results for actionable driver mutations (ie, ALK, BRAF 
p.V600E, ERBB2, EGFR, KRAS, METex14 skipping, NTRK1/2/3, RET, 
and ROS1), PD-L1 expression less than 1%, and contraindications to 
PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. Chemotherapy regimens may be used as 
first-line or subsequent therapy options in eligible patients with 
actionable driver mutations as shown in the algorithm, although they are 
generally not preferred options. Targeted therapy is a preferred first-line 
therapy option for patients with actionable driver mutations, except for 
EGFR exon 20 mutations or KRAS mutations. Recommended 
chemotherapy regimens are based on PS and include platinum agents 
(eg, cisplatin, carboplatin), taxanes (eg, paclitaxel, albumin-bound 
paclitaxel, docetaxel), vinorelbine, etoposide, pemetrexed, and 
gemcitabine. To clarify use of systemic therapy, the NCCN Guidelines list 
all the combination systemic therapy regimens and single agents that are
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 169 ===
recommended for patients with metastatic NSCLC based on histology and 
PS (see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
For patients with advanced NSCLC who have a PS of 2, platinum-based 
combinations and a few single-agent chemotherapy agents are 
recommended in the NCCN Guidelines; cisplatin-based regimens are not 
recommended in this setting.819 For nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC 
NOS, single-agent chemotherapy includes gemcitabine, pemetrexed, or 
taxanes; combination chemotherapy regimens include carboplatin plus 
paclitaxel or carboplatin plus pemetrexed.820-822 Patients with a PS of 2 are 
often just treated with single-agent chemotherapy because of concerns 
about toxicity.823 Treatment with carboplatin plus pemetrexed increased 
median overall survival when compared with pemetrexed alone (9.3 vs. 
5.3 months, P = .001) in patients with a PS of 2; however, 4 
treatment-related deaths occurred in the carboplatin plus pemetrexed 
arm.820,824 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel has preference stratified all the systemic 
therapy regimens for patients with NSCLC. The newer chemotherapy 
plus pembrolizumab regimens are preferred for eligible patients with 
metastatic NSCLC who do not have contraindications to immunotherapy 
and are not candidates for targeted therapy (see Systemic Therapy for 
Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC and 
Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in this Discussion). For patients with 
metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC and PS 0 to 1 who have 
contraindications to immunotherapy, the panel decided that the following 
chemotherapy regimens are “useful in certain circumstances,” including 
1) carboplatin with paclitaxel (or albumin-bound paclitaxel), docetaxel, 
etoposide, gemcitabine, or pemetrexed; all are category 1; 2) cisplatin 
with paclitaxel (or albumin-bound paclitaxel), docetaxel, etoposide, 
gemcitabine, or pemetrexed; all are category 1; 3) bevacizumab with 
carboplatin and either paclitaxel or pemetrexed; and 4) gemcitabine with 
either docetaxel or vinorelbine. The panel also preference stratified the 
regimens for patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC and PS 2; 
carboplatin plus pemetrexed is preferred for patients with 
adenocarcinoma. The regimens for patients with metastatic squamous 
cell NSCLC have also been preference stratified.  
The initial cytotoxic systemic therapy regimens do not include options that 
are less effective, more toxic, and/or infrequently used in the United States 
based on each panel member’s experience and data generated by 
surveying the NCCN NSCLC Panel (see the NCCN Guidelines with 
Evidence Blocks™ for NSCLC, available at www.NCCN.org). For patients 
with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC and NSCLC NOS, the following 
regimens are not recommended in the NCCN Guidelines: carboplatin plus 
vinorelbine, cisplatin plus vinorelbine, etoposide, irinotecan, and 
vinorelbine. For patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC, the 
following regimens are not recommended in the NCCN Guidelines: 
carboplatin plus vinorelbine, cisplatin plus gemcitabine plus necitumumab, 
cisplatin plus vinorelbine, etoposide, irinotecan, and vinorelbine.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel voted unanimously to not recommend the 
necitumumab plus cisplatin plus gemcitabine regimen for patients with 
metastatic squamous cell NSCLC. The NCCN NSCLC Panel feels the 
addition of necitumumab to the regimen is not beneficial based on toxicity, 
cost, and limited improvement in efficacy when compared with cisplatin 
plus gemcitabine. A phase 3 randomized trial only showed a slight 
improvement in overall survival (11.5 months; 95% CI, 10.4–12.6; vs. 9.9 
months; 95% CI, 8.9–11.1).825 The stratified HR was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.74–
0.96; P = .01). In addition, there were more grade 3 or higher adverse 
events in patients receiving the necitumumab regimen (388 [72%] of 538 
patients) than in patients receiving only gemcitabine plus cisplatin (333 
[62%] of 541). Although it has been suggested that adding necitumumab
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 170 ===
to cisplatin plus gemcitabine adds value and is cost-effective, the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel does not agree.826  
Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors  
Human ICI antibodies inhibit the PD-1 receptor or PD-L1, which 
improves antitumor immunity; PD-1 receptors are expressed on activated 
cytotoxic T cells.358-360 Cemiplimab-rwlc, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab 
inhibit PD-1 receptors;361,362,138 atezolizumab and durvalumab inhibit 
PD-L1.363,364 The single-agent immunotherapy or combination 
immunotherapy plus chemotherapy regimens are not recommended if 
patients have contraindications to immunotherapy, which may include 
active or previously documented autoimmune disease and/or current use 
of immunosuppressive agents. PD-L1 inhibitors are less beneficial in 
patients with some oncogenic drivers (ie, EGFR exon 19 deletions, 
EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, ALK rearrangements).184 Monitoring is 
recommended during initial therapy with response assessment with CT, 
with or without contrast, of known or high-risk sites of disease after 2 
cycles and then every 2 to 4 cycles. During maintenance or subsequent 
therapy, monitoring is also recommended with CT, with or without 
contrast, every 6 to 12 weeks. ICIs (also known as immunotherapy or IO 
agents) are associated with a delay in benefit when compared with 
targeted therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends IHC testing for PD-L1 expression 
(category 1) before first-line treatment in all patients with metastatic 
NSCLC, regardless of histology, based on the efficacy of pembrolizumab 
with or without chemotherapy.365 Ideally, PD-L1 expression levels are 
assessed before first-line therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC, if 
clinically feasible. Every effort also needs to be made to assess for 
oncogenic driver variants for which targeted therapies are available (eg, 
EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements). Plasma-based ctDNA testing 
can be used to evaluate for genomic alterations if the assay has been 
validated and if the patient is unfit for invasive tissue sampling or if there 
is insufficient tissue for molecular analyses; however, plasma-based 
ctDNA testing is less sensitive than tissue assays.  
It is important to note that targeted therapies are recommended for 
patients with metastatic NSCLC and specific oncogenic drivers, 
independent of PD-L1 levels. Patients with metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 
expression levels of 1% or more—but who also have a targetable driver 
oncogene molecular variant (eg, EGFR, ALK, ROS1)—should receive 
first-line targeted therapy for that oncogene and not first-line ICIs, 
because targeted therapies yield higher response rates (eg, osimertinib, 
80%) than ICIs (lower response rates) in the first-line setting, targeted 
therapy is better tolerated, and these patients are less likely to respond 
to single-agent ICIs.184,371-373,827 For patients receiving first-line ICIs with 
or without chemotherapy, oncologists should be aware of the long 
half-life of the ICIs and potential adverse effects when using osimertinib 
in combination with or following ICIs.828,829 A few case reports suggest 
that patients treated with ICIs who have acquired resistance may have 
transformation to SCLC.830  
In 2020, the NCCN Panel removed TMB as an emerging immune 
biomarker for patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data, 
concerns about variable TMB measurements, and other issues as 
previously described (see TMB in this Discussion).171,375,379 The NCCN 
Guidelines do not recommend measurement of TMB levels before 
deciding whether to use nivolumab plus ipilimumab regimens or other 
ICIs, such as pembrolizumab.171  
The following content briefly summarizes the use of ICIs as first-line or 
subsequent therapy options in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC; 
detailed information, including clinical trial data, is provided in subsequent 
sections.831 ICIs may also be used in other settings; clinical trial data and appropriate use are described in greater detail elsewhere. For example,

adjuvant atezolizumab or pembrolizumab are recommended following 
adjuvant chemotherapy for eligible patients with completely resected 
early-stage NSCLC (see Surgery Followed by Adjuvant Therapy: Trial 
Data and NCCN Recommendations in this Discussion).750,751 Durvalumab 
is recommended as a consolidation immunotherapy option for eligible 
patients with unresectable stage II or III NSCLC and without disease 
progression after treatment with definitive concurrent chemoradiation (see 
Chemoradiation in this Discussion).363  
Single-agent pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or cemiplimab-rwlc are 
recommended (category 1; preferred) as first-line therapy options for 
eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC regardless of histology, PD-L1 
expression levels of 50% or more, and negative test results for actionable 
driver mutations that have recommended first-line targeted therapies (ie, 
ALK, BRAF p.V600E, EGFR, METex14 skipping, NTRK1/2/3, RET, 
ROS1). The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends single-agent 
pembrolizumab as a first-line therapy option in eligible patients with 
metastatic NSCLC regardless of histology, PD-L1 levels of 1% to 49% 
(category 2B; useful in certain circumstances), and negative test results 
for actionable driver mutations.832  
Combination therapy with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is 
recommended (category 1; preferred) as a first-line therapy option in 
eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC and negative test results for 
actionable driver mutations, regardless of PD-L1 expression levels. 
Combination therapy with the ABCP regimen is recommended (category 
1; other recommended intervention) as a first-line therapy option for 
eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC and negative test results for 
actionable driver mutations, regardless of PD-L1 expression levels. 
Combination therapy with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy or with 
ABCP may be used as first-line or subsequent therapy options, although 
they are not preferred options, in eligible patients with actionable driver 
mutations as shown in the algorithm. Targeted therapy is a preferred 
first-line therapy option for patients with actionable driver mutations, 
except for EGFR exon 20 mutations or KRAS mutations. Continuation 
maintenance immunotherapy is recommended for 2 years, if tolerated, for 
all first-line immunotherapy (± chemotherapy) regimens.  
If patients have disease progression on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy (± 
chemotherapy), then using a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is not recommended for 
subsequent therapy.833 Single-agent pembrolizumab is recommended 
(category 1; preferred) as a subsequent therapy option for select patients 
with metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 levels greater than 1%; nivolumab or 
atezolizumab is recommended (category 1; preferred) as a subsequent 
monotherapy option for select patients with metastatic NSCLC regardless 
of PD-L1 levels. Based on data in the second-line setting, PD-1 or PD-L1 
inhibitor monotherapy appears to be less effective in patients with EGFR 
exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, or ALK 
rearrangements, regardless of PD-L1 expression levels.358,362,827,834,835 A 
small study suggests that single-agent pembrolizumab is not effective as 
first-line therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC and EGFR mutations, 
even those with PD-L1 levels more than 50%.372 Patients with 
ALK-positive NSCLC and very high PD-L1 expression levels do not 
respond to pembrolizumab.184,827 In the trials assessing the efficacy of 
first-line therapy with pembrolizumab with (or without) chemotherapy, most 
of the patients were wild type for EGFR or ALK variants. Maintenance 
immunotherapy is recommended, if tolerated, until progression for all the 
subsequent therapy regimens.  
ICIs are associated with unique immune-mediated adverse events, such 
as endocrine disorders, that are not seen with traditional cytotoxic 
chemotherapy; therefore, health care providers should be aware of the 
spectrum of potential immune-mediated adverse events, know how to 
manage the adverse events, and educate their patients about possible

side effects (see the NCCN Guidelines for the Management of 
Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities, available at www.NCCN.org).836,837 
Atezolizumab, cemiplimab-rwlc, durvalumab, nivolumab, or 
pembrolizumab should be discontinued for patients with severe or 
life-threatening pneumonitis or myocarditis and should be withheld or 
discontinued for other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated 
adverse events when indicated (see prescribing information). 
Pseudoprogression has been reported; therefore, traditional RECIST 
criteria may not be applicable.838-840  
Atezolizumab 
Atezolizumab is a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody 
that inhibits PD-L1, which improves antitumor immune response.364 
Immune-mediated adverse events may occur with ICIs, including 
atezolizumab.834,841 For patients with immune-mediated adverse events, 
intravenous high-dose corticosteroids should be administered based on 
the severity of the reaction (see the NCCN Guidelines for the Management 
of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities, available at www.NCCN.org). 
Atezolizumab should also be permanently discontinued for patients with 
severe or life-threatening pneumonitis or myocarditis and should be 
discontinued for other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated 
adverse events when indicated (see prescribing information). The 
following sections describe the use of atezolizumab in eligible patients with 
metastatic NSCLC. The use of adjuvant atezolizumab following adjuvant 
chemotherapy for eligible patients with completely resected early-stage 
NSCLC is described in a different section (see Surgery Followed by 
Adjuvant Therapy in this Discussion).750 
First-Line Therapy 
IMpower110, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared first-line therapy with 
single-agent atezolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy in three 
different subgroups of patients with metastatic NSCLC, including those
with high PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 stained ≥50% of TC [TC ≥50%] or 
PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating cells [IC] covering ≥10% of the tumor area 
[IC ≥ 10%]); patients were wild type for EGFR or ALK variants and most 
either currently or previously smoked cigarettes.842,843 Patients receiving 
first-line atezolizumab monotherapy also received maintenance therapy 
with atezolizumab. Chemotherapy regimens for patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC included cisplatin (or carboplatin) plus pemetrexed 
and maintenance therapy with pemetrexed; patients with squamous cell 
NSCLC received cisplatin plus gemcitabine and best supportive care as 
maintenance therapy. Atezolizumab monotherapy was associated with 
fatal adverse reactions in 3.8% of all patients (11/286, all 3 groups), 
including aspiration, COPD, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial 
infarction, cardiac arrest, mechanical ileus, sepsis, cerebral infraction, and 
device occlusion; 4.2% of patients (11/263) receiving chemotherapy also 
died. Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 12.9% of 
patients receiving atezolizumab monotherapy versus 44.1% with 
chemotherapy. The most frequent serious adverse reactions with 
atezolizumab monotherapy were pneumonia (2.8%), COPD (2.1%), and 
pneumonitis (2.1%); 28% of patients had serious adverse reactions. 
It is important to note that a different IHC assay was used to test for PD-L1 
levels in IMpower110 (SP142 PD-L1 IHC assay) compared with IHC 
assays used for pembrolizumab monotherapy in KEYNOTE-024 (PD-L1 
IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay); however, the results were similar regardless 
of which PD-L1 IHC assay was used.842,844 Data suggest that different 
methods of testing for PD-L1 levels are not equivalent.368,369 Based on an  
analysis using the SP142 PD-L1 IHC assay, median OS was 20.2 months 
(95% CI,16.5–not estimable) with atezolizumab monotherapy (n = 107) 
versus 13.1 months (95% CI, 7.4–16.5 months) with chemotherapy (n = 
98) (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40–0.89; P=.0106) in patients with high PD-L1 
expression. Based on an analysis using the 22C3 pharmDx assay, median
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 173 ===
OS was 20.2 months with atezolizumab monotherapy (n = 134) versus 
11.0 months with chemotherapy (n = 126) (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41–
0.86).842,844 There was no survival advantage in the other two subgroups of 
patients with lower PD-L1 expression (ie, TC ≥ 5% or IC ≥ 5%; TC ≥ 1% or 
IC ≥ 1%).  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends atezolizumab monotherapy 
(category 1; preferred) as a first-line therapy option for eligible patients 
with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data and FDA approval. 
842,843 Atezolizumab monotherapy is recommended as a first-line therapy 
option for patients with metastatic NSCLC, PD-L1 levels of 50% or more, 
and negative test results for actionable driver mutations, regardless of 
histology; maintenance therapy with atezolizumab is also recommended in 
this setting. Cemiplimab-rwlc and pembrolizumab are also recommended 
first-line therapy options in this setting (category 1; preferred). The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel has preference stratified the ICI regimens and decided that 
atezolizumab, cemiplimab-rwlc, and pembrolizumab (all are category 1) 
are preferred first-line therapy options for eligible patients with metastatic 
NSCLC based on clinical trial data.138,361,832,842  
IMpower150, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared first-line therapy with 
the ABCP regimen versus bevacizumab plus chemotherapy for patients 
with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC.841 Median overall survival was 19.2 
months (95% CI, 17.0–23.8) in the ABCP arm versus 14.7 months (95% 
CI, 13.3–16.9) in the carboplatin plus paclitaxel plus bevacizumab arm; the 
HR for death was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.64–0.96; P = .02). PFS was longer in 
the ABCP arm versus chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (8.3 vs. 6.8 
months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52–0.74; P < .001). Some patients with 
EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (n = 108) and disease 
progression on (or were intolerant of) prior TKI were enrolled in this trial, 
although most patients (87%) did not have these genetic variants. In these 
patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, PFS was also 
increased with ABCP compared with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab 
(9.7 vs. 6.1 months; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37–0.94). A subgroup analysis of 
IMpower150 reported that subsequent therapy with the ABCP regimen 
increased median overall survival in a few patients with EGFR mutation–
positive metastatic NSCLC (n = 34) compared with those receiving 
carboplatin plus paclitaxel plus bevacizumab (n = 45).845 Therefore, the 
ABCP regimen may be an option for patients with EGFR mutations or ALK 
rearrangements and disease progression after initial therapy with TKIs.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends the ABCP regimen (category 1; 
other recommended intervention) as a first-line therapy option for eligible 
patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC (including 
adenocarcinoma) based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.841 The 
ABCP regimen (also known as the quadruplicate regimen) is 
recommended as a first-line therapy option for patients with negative test 
results for actionable driver mutations (ie, ALK, BRAF p.V600E, EGFR, 
METex14 skipping, NTRK1/2/3, RET, and ROS1), regardless of PD-L1 
expression levels. Combination therapy with the ABCP regimen may be 
used as a first-line or subsequent therapy option, although it is not a 
preferred option, in eligible patients with actionable driver mutations as 
shown in the algorithm. Targeted therapy is a preferred first-line therapy 
option for patients with actionable driver mutations, except for EGFR exon 
20 mutations or KRAS mutations. Maintenance therapy with atezolizumab 
and bevacizumab is also recommended in this setting (category 1) (see 
Maintenance Therapy in this Discussion). The NCCN NSCLC Panel has 
preference stratified the systemic therapy regimens and decided that the 
ABCP regimen is an other recommended intervention, because the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel prefers the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy regimens 
based on tolerability and experience with these regimens. The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends that bevacizumab biosimilars may be used in 
any of the systemic therapy regimens containing bevacizumab, such as

ABCP, that are used for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on 
clinical data and FDA approvals.833,846-849 
IMpower130, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared atezolizumab plus 
carboplatin plus albumin-bound paclitaxel versus chemotherapy alone as 
first-line therapy in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with no 
EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements.850 Median overall survival was 
18.6 months (95% CI, 16.0–21.2) in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy 
arm versus 13.9 months (95% CI, 12.0–18.7) in carboplatin plus 
albumin-bound paclitaxel arm (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64–0.98; P = .033). 
Treatment-related deaths were reported in 2% (8/473) of patients in the 
atezolizumab plus chemotherapy arm and in less than 1% (1/232) of 
patients in the chemotherapy-only arm.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends atezolizumab plus carboplatin plus 
albumin-bound paclitaxel (other recommended intervention) as a first-line 
therapy option for eligible patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC 
based on clinical trial data.850 Atezolizumab plus carboplatin plus 
albumin-bound paclitaxel is recommended as a first-line therapy option for 
patients with metastatic NSCLC and negative test results for actionable 
driver mutations, regardless of PD-L1 levels. The atezolizumab plus 
carboplatin plus albumin-bound paclitaxel regimen may be used as a 
first-line or subsequent therapy option, although it is not a preferred option, 
in eligible patients with actionable driver mutations as shown in the 
algorithm. Maintenance therapy with atezolizumab is also recommended 
in these settings. Targeted therapy is a preferred first-line therapy option 
for patients with actionable driver mutations, except for EGFR exon 20 
mutations or KRAS mutations. 
Subsequent Therapy 
OAK, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared atezolizumab versus 
docetaxel in patients with metastatic NSCLC and disease progression 
during or after systemic therapy.834,851 Most patients either currently or 
previously smoked cigarettes and had received platinum-based 
chemotherapy; 10% of patients were not reported because they had 
EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements.834,851 Patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC who received atezolizumab had longer overall 
survival (15.6 months; 95% CI, 13.3–17.6) when compared with those 
receiving docetaxel (11.2 months; 95% CI, 9.3–12.6; HR, 0.73; 0.6–0.89; 
P = .0015). In patients with squamous cell NSCLC, overall survival was 
8.9 months (95% CI, 7.4–12.8) in patients receiving atezolizumab versus 
7.7 months (95% CI, 6.3–8.9) with docetaxel (HR, 0.73; 0.54–0.98; P = 
.038). Fewer patients were in the squamous group compared with the 
nonsquamous group (222 vs. 628). Fewer treatment-related severe 
adverse events (grades 3–4) were reported for atezolizumab versus 
docetaxel (15% vs. 43% [90/609 vs. 247/578]).  
If patients have not previously received a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends atezolizumab (category 1; preferred) as a 
subsequent therapy option for patients with metastatic nonsquamous or 
squamous cell NSCLC based on clinical trial data and FDA 
approval.364,834,851 Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are also recommended 
subsequent therapy options in this setting (category 1; preferred). Testing 
for PD-L1 expression levels is not required for prescribing subsequent 
therapy with atezolizumab or nivolumab but may provide useful 
information. If patients have progressed on a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, then 
using a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is not recommended.  
Cemiplimab-rwlc  
Cemiplimab-rwlc is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal 
antibody that inhibits PD-1 receptors, which improves antitumor immune 
response.361 Immune-mediated adverse events may occur with ICIs, 
including cemiplimab-rwlc.361 For patients with immune-mediated adverse 
events, intravenous high-dose corticosteroids should be administered
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 175 ===
based on the severity of the reaction. Cemiplimab-rwlc should also be 
permanently discontinued for patients with grades 2, 3, or 4 myocarditis 
and should be discontinued for other severe or life-threatening 
immune-mediated adverse events when indicated (see prescribing 
information).  
EMPOWER-Lung 1, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared first-line 
therapy with single-agent cemiplimab versus platinum-based 
chemotherapy for patients with metastatic squamous or nonsquamous 
NSCLC, PD-L1 levels of 50% or more, and negative test results for EGFR 
mutations, ALK rearrangements, or ROS1 rearrangements.361 Patients 
receiving first-line cemiplimab also received maintenance therapy with 
cemiplimab. Median overall survival was not reached for patients receiving 
cemiplimab (95% CI, 17.9–not evaluable) versus 14.2 months (95% CI, 
11.2–17.5) for chemotherapy (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42–0.77; P=.0002). 
The response rate was 39% (95% CI, 34%–45%) for those receiving 
cemiplimab versus 20% (95% CI, 16%–26%) for chemotherapy. Of 
patients treated with cemiplimab, 28% (98/355) had grade 3 to 4 adverse 
events compared with 39% (135/342) for those treated with 
chemotherapy. Treated-related deaths occurred in 2.5% (9/355) of 
patients receiving cemiplimab versus 2.0% (7/342) with chemotherapy. 
The cemiplimab-related deaths were due to autoimmune myocarditis, 
cardiac failure, cardiopulmonary failure, cardiorespiratory arrest, nephritis, 
respiratory failure, septic shock, tumor hyperprogression, and unknown 
reasons.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends cemiplimab-rwlc monotherapy 
(category 1; preferred) as a first-line therapy option for eligible patients 
with metastatic NSCLC regardless of histology, PD-L1 levels of 50% or 
more, and negative test results for actionable driver mutations based on 
clinical trial data and FDA approval; maintenance therapy with 
cemiplimab-rwlc is also recommended.361 Atezolizumab and 
pembrolizumab are also recommended first-line therapy options in this 
setting (category 1; preferred). The NCCN NSCLC Panel has preference 
stratified the ICI regimens and decided that atezolizumab, 
cemiplimab-rwlc, and pembrolizumab (all are category 1) are preferred 
first-line therapy options for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based 
on clinical trial data.138,361,832,842  
EMPOWER-Lung 3, a randomized phase 3 trial, assessed first-line 
therapy with cemiplimab plus platinum-based chemotherapy versus 
platinum-based chemotherapy alone in 466 patients with advanced 
NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 levels or histology. The chemotherapy 
regimens included 1) cemiplimab plus paclitaxel plus either cisplatin or 
carboplatin for either nonsquamous NSCLC or squamous cell histology; or 
2) cemiplimab plus pemetrexed plus either cisplatin or carboplatin for 
nonsquamous NSCLC.852 Patients received maintenance therapy if 
indicated. Most patients (85%) had stage IV NSCLC and 57% had 
nonsquamous NSCLC. Most patients either currently smoked cigarettes 
(55%) or had previously smoked (31%). Patients did not have EGFR, ALK, 
or ROS1 mutations. The median overall survival was 21.9 months (95% 
CI, 15.5–not evaluable) with cemiplimab plus chemotherapy versus 13.0 
months (95% CI, 11.9–16.1) with chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 
0.53–0.93; P = .01). Subgroup analysis showed that overall survival was 
similar between the groups for PD-L1 levels less than 1%, nonsquamous 
NSCLC, and other subgroups; however, the trial was not powered to 
detect differences in efficacy within the subgroups. Grade 3 or higher 
treatment-related adverse events occurred in 44% (136/312) of patients 
receiving cemiplimab plus chemotherapy, and 31% (48/153) of patients 
receiving chemotherapy alone. Immune-related adverse events occurred 
in 19% of patients receiving cemiplimab plus chemotherapy. Death 
occurred in 6.1% (19/312) of patients receiving cemiplimab plus 
chemotherapy versus 7.8% (12/153) of patients receiving chemotherapy 
alone. One patient died from immune-mediated pneumonitis

The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends cemiplimab-rwlc plus 
platinum-based chemotherapy regimens as first-line therapy options 
(category 1; other recommended) for eligible patients with metastatic 
NSCLC—regardless of histology or PD-L1 levels and with negative test 
results for actionable driver mutations—based on clinical trial data and 
FDA approval; maintenance therapy with cemiplimab-rwlc with or without 
pemetrexed is also recommended.852 Combination therapy with 
cemiplimab-rwlc plus platinum-based chemotherapy may be used as a 
first-line or subsequent therapy option, although it is not a preferred option, 
in eligible patients with actionable driver mutations as shown in the 
algorithm. Targeted therapy is a preferred first-line therapy option for 
patients with actionable driver mutations, except for EGFR exon 20 
mutations or KRAS mutations. The NCCN Panel has preference stratified 
the cemiplimab-rwlc plus chemotherapy regimens and decided that they 
are other recommended first-line therapy options for eligible patients with 
metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data.852 
Nivolumab with or Without Ipilimumab  
Nivolumab and ipilimumab are ICIs that have complementary mechanisms 
of action on T cells; nivolumab is used either with or without ipilimumab, 
depending on the setting. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 
monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-1 receptors, which improves 
antitumor immune response.358,362,138 PD-1 receptors are expressed on 
activated cytotoxic T cells.358-360 Ipilimumab is a human cytotoxic 
T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)–blocking antibody that binds to CTLA-4 
and prevents the interactions with CD80/CD86, which induces de novo 
T-cell responses against tumors; CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell activation.853 
Immune-mediated adverse events may occur with ICIs, including 
nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab.379 For patients with 
immune-mediated adverse events, intravenous high-dose corticosteroids 
should be administered based on the severity of the reaction (see the 
NCCN Guidelines for the Management of Immunotherapy Related
Toxicities, available at www.NCCN.org). Nivolumab either with or without 
ipilimumab should also be permanently discontinued for patients with 
severe or life-threatening pneumonitis or myocarditis and should be 
discontinued for other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated 
adverse events when indicated (see prescribing information). If patients 
are receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab and have treatment-related 
adverse events, it may be reasonable to discontinue ipilimumab and 
continue nivolumab.379  
First-Line Therapy 
CheckMate 227, a phase 3 randomized trial with a complex design, 
compared first-line therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab 
monotherapy, or chemotherapy for patients with metastatic nonsquamous 
or squamous NSCLC who had PD-L1 expression levels of 1% or more, PS 
0 to 1, and no EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements. First-line therapy 
with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab plus chemotherapy, or 
chemotherapy alone was also compared for patients with PD-L1 
expression levels less than 1%. In addition, first-line therapy with 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab or chemotherapy was compared as one of the 
co-primary analyses in patients who had high TMB levels (≥10 
mutations/megabase).378 Preliminary data for PFS from CHECKMATE 227 
suggested that TMB might be a useful immune biomarker for deciding 
whether to use immunotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC.378 
However, updated data from CHECKMATE 227 showed that overall 
survival was improved with nivolumab plus ipilimumab regardless of TMB 
or PD-L1 expression levels.379 
The PFS rate at 1 year was 42.6% for nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 
13.2% for chemotherapy alone. The median PFS for nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab was 7.2 months (95% CI, 5.5–13.2) compared with 5.5 months 
for chemotherapy alone (95% CI, 4.4–5.8) (HR for disease progression or 
death, 0.58; 97.5% CI, 0.41–0.81; P < .001). The objective response rate
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 177 ===
for nivolumab plus ipilimumab was 45.3% versus 26.9% with 
chemotherapy alone; nivolumab plus ipilimumab was beneficial regardless 
of PD-L1 expression levels or histology. The rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse 
events was similar for nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy 
alone (31% vs. 36%). The median PFS was not significantly different when 
comparing nivolumab monotherapy (N = 71) (4.2 months; 95% CI, 2.7–
8.3) versus chemotherapy (N = 79) (5.6 months; 95% CI, 4.5–7.0). 
Updated results from CheckMate 227 for patients with PD-L1 expression 
of 1% or more, reported that the median overall survival was 17.1 months 
(95% CI, 15.0–20.1) for nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 14.9 months 
(95% CI, 12.7–16.7) for chemotherapy (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65–0.96; P = 
.007).379 For patients with PD-L1 levels of 1% or more, the 4-year overall 
survival rate was 29% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 18% for 
those receiving chemotherapy (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65–0.90).854 For 
patients with PD-L1 levels less than 1%, the 4-year overall survival rate 
was 24% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 10% for those receiving 
chemotherapy (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51–0.81). 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends nivolumab plus ipilimumab as a 
first-line therapy option for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based 
on clinical trial data and FDA approval.378,379,381 Nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
is recommended for patients with metastatic NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 
levels or histology, negative test results for actionable driver mutations (ie, 
ALK, BRAF p.V600E, EGFR, METex14 skipping, NTRK1/2/3, RET, 
ROS1), and no contraindications to immunotherapy. For patients with 
PD-L1 levels of 1% or more, the NCCN recommendation is category 1 for 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab is also a 
recommended option for patients with PD-L1 levels less than 1%. 
Maintenance therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab is also 
recommended. Combination therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab may 
be used as a first-line or subsequent therapy option, although it is not a 
preferred option in eligible patients with actionable driver mutations as
shown in the algorithm. Targeted therapy is a preferred first-line therapy 
option for patients with actionable driver mutations, except for EGFR exon 
20 mutations or KRAS mutations.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel has preference stratified the systemic therapy 
regimens and decided that first-line therapy with nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab is “useful in certain circumstances” (eg, renal impairment) for 
patients with PD-L1 levels of 50% or more and is an “other recommended” 
first-line therapy option for patients with PD-L1 levels less than 50%. For 
the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel revised the preference 
stratification for first-line therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab to an 
“other recommended” option from useful in certain circumstances in 
patients with PD-L1 levels of 1% to 49%. Previously, the NCCN Panel 
deleted TMB as an emerging immune biomarker based on clinical trial 
data and other issues (see TMB in this Discussion).171 The NCCN 
Guidelines do not recommend measurement of TMB levels before 
deciding whether to use nivolumab plus ipilimumab regimens or to use 
other ICIs, such as pembrolizumab.171 
CheckMate 9LA, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared first-line 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy 
versus 4 cycles of chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression 
levels, who had PS 0 to 1 and no EGFR mutations or ALK 
rearrangements.855 For metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the 
chemotherapy was pemetrexed with either cisplatin or carboplatin; for 
metastatic squamous NSCLC, the chemotherapy was paclitaxel with 
carboplatin. Updated data show that the median overall survival with 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy was 15.8 months (95% CI, 
13.9–19.7) versus 11.0 months (95% CI, 9.5–12.7) with chemotherapy 
alone regardless of histology or PD-L1 expression levels (HR, 0.72; 95% 
CI, 0.61–0.86).856 In patients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus

=== PAGE 178 ===
chemotherapy, the 2-year overall survival rate was 38% versus 26% in 
those receiving chemotherapy alone. Based on histology or PD-1 levels, 
overall survival was also significantly different in patients receiving 
nivolumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The 
overall response rate was 38% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus 
chemotherapy versus 25% with chemotherapy alone.  
Serious grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 25.4% of patients 
receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy versus 15% in 
those receiving chemotherapy alone. The death rate was 2% in each arm 
(nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy: 7/358; chemotherapy 
alone: 6/349). In the nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy arm, 
treatment-related deaths were from acute renal failure due to 
chemotherapy, thrombocytopenia, pneumonitis, hepatic toxicity, hepatitis, 
diarrhea, sepsis, and acute renal insufficiency; treatment-related deaths in 
the chemotherapy arm were from anemia, pancytopenia, febrile 
neutropenia, respiratory failure, pulmonary sepsis, and sepsis. The most 
common treatment-related adverse events (≥15%) were nausea, anemia, 
asthenia, and diarrhea.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus 
chemotherapy (category 1; other recommended) as first-line therapy 
options for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial 
data and FDA approval.855,857 For metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the 
recommended chemotherapy is pemetrexed with either cisplatin or 
carboplatin; for metastatic squamous NSCLC, the recommended 
chemotherapy is paclitaxel with carboplatin. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
plus chemotherapy is recommended for patients with metastatic NSCLC, 
regardless of PD-L1 levels; negative test results for actionable driver 
mutations; and no contraindications to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. 
Maintenance therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab is also 
recommended. Combination therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab may 
be used as a first-line or subsequent therapy option, although it is not a 
preferred option, in eligible patients with actionable driver mutations as 
shown in the algorithm. Targeted therapy is a preferred first-line therapy 
option for patients with actionable driver mutations, except for EGFR exon 
20 mutations or KRAS mutations. The panel has preference stratified the 
systemic therapy regimens and voted that first-line therapy with nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy is an “other recommended” first-line 
therapy option for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC regardless of 
PD-L1 expression levels or histology.  
Subsequent Therapy 
CheckMate-057, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared nivolumab versus 
docetaxel as subsequent therapy for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC and disease progression on or after first-line 
chemotherapy.358 Median overall survival was 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.7–
15.0) for patients receiving nivolumab compared with 9.4 months (95% CI, 
8.1–10.7) for docetaxel (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.89; P = .002).358 The 
median duration of response was 17.2 months with nivolumab compared 
with 5.6 months for docetaxel. At 18 months, the overall survival rate was 
39% (95% CI, 34%–45%) with nivolumab compared with 23% (95% CI, 
19%–28%) for docetaxel. Fewer grade 3 to 5 adverse events were 
reported for nivolumab (10%) when compared with docetaxel (54%). 
Although many patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC benefit 
from nivolumab, those whose tumors have PD-L1 staining of 1% to 10% or 
more have an overall survival of 17 to 19 months compared with 8 to 9 
months for docetaxel. For patients who did not have PD-L1 expression, 
there was no difference in overall survival for nivolumab versus docetaxel; 
however, nivolumab was associated with a longer duration of response 
and fewer side effects. 
CheckMate-017, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared nivolumab versus 
docetaxel as subsequent therapy for patients with metastatic NSCLC

=== PAGE 179 ===
squamous cell and disease progression on or after first-line 
chemotherapy.362 Median overall survival was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.3–
13.3) for nivolumab compared with 6.0 months (95% CI, 5.1–7.3) for 
docetaxel (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44–0.79; P < .001).362 Patients had a 
response rate of 20% with nivolumab compared with 9% for docetaxel (P 
= .008). PD-L1 expression was not associated with response to nivolumab 
in patients with squamous cell NSCLC. Fewer grade 3 to 4 adverse events 
were reported with nivolumab (7%) compared with docetaxel (55%). No 
patients died in the nivolumab arm versus three deaths in the docetaxel 
arm. 
In a long-term analysis of CheckMate-057 and CheckMate-017, 2-year 
survival and durable responses were increased in patients with advanced 
NSCLC receiving nivolumab when compared with docetaxel.858 For 
patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, 2-year survival was 29% (95% CI, 
24%–34%) with nivolumab versus 16% (95% CI, 12%–20%) with 
docetaxel. For those with squamous NSCLC, 2-year survival was 23% 
(95% CI, 16%–30%) with nivolumab versus 8% (95% CI, 4%–13%) with 
docetaxel. Fewer severe treatment-related adverse events were reported 
with nivolumab compared with docetaxel (grade 3–4, 10% vs. 55%). At 5 
years, overall survival was 13.4% for patients receiving nivolumab versus 
2.6% for those receiving docetaxel.17 
If patients have not previously received a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends single-agent nivolumab (category 1; 
preferred) as a subsequent therapy option for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC and disease progression on or after 
first-line chemotherapy based on clinical trial data and FDA 
approval.358,362,858,859 Testing for PD-L1 is not required for prescribing 
nivolumab but may provide useful information.370 The NCCN NSCLC 
Panel recommends nivolumab, atezolizumab, or pembrolizumab as 
preferred subsequent therapy options (category 1 for all) based on 
improved overall survival rates, longer duration of response, and fewer 
adverse events when compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy.358,362,835,860 If 
patients have progressed on a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, then using a 
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is not recommended.  
Immune-related adverse events, such as pneumonitis, may occur with 
nivolumab.360,861-867 Intravenous high-dose corticosteroids should be 
administered for patients with immune-mediated adverse events based on 
the severity of the reaction (see the NCCN Guidelines for the Management 
of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities, available at www.NCCN.org). 
Nivolumab should be discontinued for patients with severe or 
life-threatening pneumonitis or myocarditis and should be withheld or 
discontinued for other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated 
adverse events when indicated (see prescribing information).  
Pembrolizumab 
Pembrolizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody 
that inhibits PD-1 receptors, which improves antitumor immune 
response.362,138 The FDA has approved a companion diagnostic 
biomarker test for assessing PD-L1 expression and determining which 
patients are eligible for pembrolizumab therapy. Although it is not an 
optimal biomarker, PD-L1 expression is currently the best available 
biomarker to assess whether patients are candidates for 
pembrolizumab.366,367 PD-L1 expression is continuously variable and 
dynamic; thus, a cutoff value for a positive result is artificial. Patients with 
PD-L1 expression levels just below and just above 50% will probably have 
similar responses.366 Unique anti-PD-L1 IHC assays have been developed 
for each one of the different ICIs currently available.366,370 The definition of 
a positive PD-L1 test result varies depending on which biomarker assay is 
used.370  
Immune-mediated adverse events may occur with ICIs, including pembrollizumab. For patients with immune mediated adverse

events, intravenous high-dose corticosteroids should be administered 
based on the severity of the reaction (see the NCCN Guidelines for the 
Management of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities, available at 
www.NCCN.org). Pembrolizumab should also be discontinued for patients 
with severe or life-threatening pneumonitis or myocarditis and should be 
withheld or discontinued for other severe or life-threatening 
immune-mediated adverse events when indicated (see prescribing 
information). The following sections describe the use of pembrolizumab in 
eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC. The use of adjuvant 
pembrolizumab following adjuvant chemotherapy in eligible patients with 
completely resected NSCLC is described in a different section (see 
Surgery Followed by Adjuvant Therapy in this Discussion).751  
First-Line Monotherapy 
KEYNOTE-024, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared single-agent 
pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy 
for patients with advanced nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC and PD-L1 
expression levels of 50% or more, but without EGFR mutations or ALK 
rearrangements.9,12,138 At 6 months, the rate of overall survival was 80.2% 
with pembrolizumab monotherapy versus 72.4% with chemotherapy (HR 
for death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41–0.89; P = .005). Reponses were higher for 
pembrolizumab than for chemotherapy (44.8% vs. 27.8%).138 An updated 
analysis of KEYNOTE-024 showed that median overall survival was 26.3 
months (95% CI, 18.3 months–40.4) with pembrolizumab monotherapy 
compared with 13.4 months (95% CI, 9.4–18.3 months) with 
chemotherapy (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48–0.81).12 The 5-year overall 
survival rate was 31.9% for pembrolizumab and 16.3% for 
chemotherapy. Fewer severe treatment-related adverse events (grades 
3–5) were reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy 
compared with those receiving chemotherapy (31.2% vs. 53.3%).9 
Treatment-related deaths occurred in 1.3% (2/154) of patients receiving 
pembrolizumab monotherapy versus 2% (3/150) of patients receiving 
chemotherapy alone.  
KEYNOTE-042, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared single-agent 
pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy 
for patients with advanced nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC and PD-L1 
expression levels of 1% or more, but without EGFR mutations or ALK 
rearrangements.832 Overall survival was 20.0 months (95% CI, 15.4–24.9) 
in patients with PD-L1 levels of 50% or more who received single-agent 
pembrolizumab compared with 12.2 months (95% CI, 10.4–14.2) with 
chemotherapy (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56–0.85; P = .0003). In a subgroup 
analysis, overall survival was similar in patients with PD-L1 levels of 1% to 
49% who received single-agent pembrolizumab (13.4 months; 95% CI, 
10.7–18.2) compared with chemotherapy (12.1 months; 95% CI, 11.0–
14.0) (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77–1.11).  
Long-term data from KEYNOTE-001 show that 5-year survival for 
patients with metastatic NSCLC is approximately 23% for patients who 
received first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy; for patients with PD-L1 
levels of 50% or more, 5-year overall survival is about 29.6%.19 Median 
overall survival was 22.3 months (95% CI, 17.1–32.3) for 
treatment-naïve patients. For patients with metastatic NSCLC receiving 
chemotherapy alone, 5-year overall survival is approximately 6%.19  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends IHC testing for PD-L1 expression 
(category 1) before first-line treatment in all patients with metastatic 
NSCLC based on the efficacy of pembrolizumab (see Principles of 
Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).365 
The panel recommends single-agent pembrolizumab (category 1; 
preferred) as a first-line therapy option for eligible patients with advanced 
nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC, PD-L1 expression levels of 50% or 
more, no contraindications to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, and negative test results for actionalble driver mutations based on clinical trial data and FDA

approval. Maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab is also a 
recommended option in this setting (category 1). The NCCN NSCLC 
Panel has preference stratified the ICI regimens and decided that 
pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and cemiplimab-rwlc (all are category 1) 
are all preferred single-agent options for eligible patients with metastatic 
NSCLC.138,361,832,842 For patients who have disease progression on 
first-line therapy with single-agent pembrolizumab, subsequent therapy 
with initial cytotoxic systemic therapy regimens (eg, carboplatin plus 
paclitaxel) is recommended by the NCCN NSCLC Panel.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends single-agent pembrolizumab 
as a first-line therapy option (category 2B; useful in certain 
circumstances) for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC, PD-L1 
expression levels of 1% to 49%, no contraindications to PD-1 or PD-L1 
inhibitors, and negative test results for actionable driver mutations based 
on clinical trial data and FDA approval.832,869 The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
decided that single-agent pembrolizumab is a useful intervention in 
patients with PD-L1 levels of 1% to 49% when there are contradictions to 
combination chemotherapy (category 2B; useful in certain 
circumstances). In patients with PD-L1 levels of 1% to 49%, the HR of 
0.92 is not statistically or clinically significant for pembrolizumab 
monotherapy versus chemotherapy; therefore, pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy is recommended (category 1; preferred) if patients can 
tolerate the therapy.  
First-Line Combination Therapy 
KEYNOTE-189, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared pembrolizumab 
added to carboplatin (or cisplatin) plus pemetrexed versus chemotherapy 
in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC.711 Most patients 
received pembrolizumab plus carboplatin plus pemetrexed (72% 
[445/616]) in this trial, but some received pembrolizumab plus cisplatin 
plus pemetrexed (28% [171/616]); patients did not have EGFR mutations 
or ALK rearrangements. The estimated rate of overall survival at one year 
was 69.2% (95% CI, 64.1%–73.8%) in patients receiving pembrolizumab 
plus chemotherapy versus 49.4% (95% CI, 42.1%–56.2%) for 
chemotherapy alone (HR for death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38–0.64; P < .001) 
after a median follow-up of 10.5 months. Overall survival was improved 
regardless of PD-L1 expression levels; TMB did not predict for 
response.870 For the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group, median 
PFS was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.6–9.2) compared with 4.9 months (95% 
CI, 4.7–5.5) for chemotherapy alone (HR for disease progression or death, 
0.52; 95% CI, 0.43–0.64; P < .001). Grade 3 or higher adverse events 
occurred at a similar rate in both arms (pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy, 67.2% vs. chemotherapy, 65.8%).  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed 
and either carboplatin or cisplatin (category 1; preferred) as a first-line 
therapy option for eligible patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC 
(ie, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma) or NSCLC NOS based on 
clinical trial data and FDA approval.711,712 The NCCN NSCLC Panel has 
preference stratified the systemic therapy regimens and decided that 
these pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy regimens are preferred first-line 
options for eligible patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. These 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy regimens are recommended (category 
1; preferred) as first-line therapy options for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC, no contraindications to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, 
and negative test results for actionable driver mutations, regardless of 
their PD-L1 expression levels. Maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab 
plus pemetrexed is also a recommended option (category 1) in this setting. 
Combination therapy with pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and either 
carboplatin or cisplatin may be used as a first-line or subsequent therapy 
option in eligible patients with actionable driver mutations as shown in the 
algorithm. However, targeted therapy is a preferred first-line therapy option 
for patients with actionable driver mutations except for EGFR exon 20

mutations or KRAS mutations. For patients with metastatic NSCLC and 
disease progression on combination therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors 
plus chemotherapy, subsequent therapy with docetaxel (with or without 
ramucirumab), pemetrexed (nonsquamous only), albumin-bound 
paclitaxel, or gemcitabine is recommended if not previously given. 
KEYNOTE-407, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared pembrolizumab 
added to carboplatin and either paclitaxel or albumin-bound paclitaxel in 
patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC; 32% of patients received 
albumin-bound paclitaxel (also known as nab-paclitaxel).871 Median 
overall survival was 15.9 months (95% CI, 13.2–not reached) with 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5–
14.8) with chemotherapy alone (HR for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49–0.85; 
P < .001). Patients receiving pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy had an 
overall response rate of 57.9% compared to 38.4% for those receiving 
chemotherapy alone. Only 38% of patients had a PD-L1 tumor proportion 
score (TPS) less than 1%. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were 
similar in both groups (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, 69.8% vs. 
chemotherapy alone, 68.2%). Because of adverse events, more patients 
discontinued treatment with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy than with 
chemotherapy (13.3% vs. 6.4%, respectively). A pooled analysis of three 
randomized trials (ie, KEYNOTE-189, KEYNOTE-407, KEYNOTE-021) in 
patients with metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 levels less than 1% showed 
that overall survival was improved in those receiving pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50–
0.79).872  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends pembrolizumab plus carboplatin 
and either paclitaxel or albumin-bound paclitaxel (category 1; preferred) 
as a first-line therapy option for patients with metastatic squamous cell 
NSCLC based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.871,873 Maintenance 
therapy with pembrolizumab is also a recommended option in this setting 
(category 1). The NCCN NSCLC Panel has preference stratified the 
systemic therapy regimens and decided that these pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy regimens are preferred for eligible patients with metastatic 
squamous cell NSCLC. These pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
regimens are recommended (category 1; preferred) as first-line therapy 
options for patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC, no 
contraindications to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, and negative test results for 
actionable driver mutations, regardless of their PD-L1 expression levels. 
The panel does not recommend pembrolizumab plus cisplatin with either 
paclitaxel or albumin-bound paclitaxel, because there are fewer data for 
this regimen. Combination therapy with pembrolizumab plus carboplatin 
and either paclitaxel or albumin-bound paclitaxel may be used as a 
first-line or subsequent therapy option in eligible patients with actionable 
driver mutations as shown in the algorithm. However, targeted therapy is 
a preferred first-line therapy option for patients with actionable driver 
mutations, except for EGFR exon 20 mutations or KRAS mutations. 
Subsequent Therapy 
KEYNOTE-010, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed single-agent 
pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated advanced 
nonsquamous and squamous NSCLC who were PD-L1 positive (≥1%); 
most patients either currently or previously smoked cigarettes.835 There 
were three arms in this trial: pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg, pembrolizumab at 
10 mg/kg, and docetaxel at 75 mg/m² every 3 weeks. The median overall 
survival was 10.4 months for the lower dose of pembrolizumab, 12.7 
months for the higher dose, and 8.5 months for docetaxel. Overall survival 
was significantly longer for both doses of pembrolizumab versus docetaxel 
(pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg: HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58–0.88; P = .0008) 
(pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg: HR, 0.61; CI, 0.49–0.75; P < .0001). For those 
patients with at least 50% PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, overall survival 
was also significantly longer at either dose of pembrolizumab when 
compared with docetaxel (pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg: 14.9 vs 8.2 months;
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 183 ===
HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38–0.77; P = .0002) (pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg: 17.3 
vs. 8.2 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.36–0.70; P < .0001). When compared 
with docetaxel, there were fewer grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse 
events at either dose of pembrolizumab (pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg: 13% 
[43/339] of patients, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg: 16% [55/343] of patients; 
and docetaxel: 35% [109/309] of patients). A total of six treatment-related 
deaths occurred in patients receiving pembrolizumab (three at each dose) 
and five treatment-related deaths occurred in the docetaxel arm. 
Long-term data from KEYNOTE-010 show that 5-year survival for 
patients with metastatic NSCLC is approximately 15.6% for patients who 
received subsequent pembrolizumab monotherapy versus 6.5% for those 
receiving docetaxel. For patients with PD-L1 levels of 50% or more, 
5-year overall survival was about 25% for patients receiving 
pembrolizumab versus 8.2% for those receiving docetaxel, 
respectively.11  
If patients have not previously received a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends single-agent pembrolizumab (category 1; 
preferred) as a subsequent therapy option for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC and PD-L1 expression levels of 1% or 
more based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.835,874,875 Nivolumab 
and atezolizumab are also recommended subsequent therapy options in 
this setting (category 1; preferred). Testing for PD-L1 expression levels is 
recommended before prescribing pembrolizumab monotherapy (see 
Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC).  
Tremelimumab-actl and Durvalumab  
Tremelimumab-actl is a monoclonal IgG2 antibody that enhances immune 
function by inhibiting CTLA-4 and preventing interactions with 
CD80/CD86; CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell activation.876 Durvalumab is a human 
immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-L1 binding to 
PD-1 and CD80, thus increasing immune function (see Durvalumab in this 
Discussion). Immune-mediated adverse events may occur with ICIs, 
including tremelimumab-actl and durvalumab.876 For patients with 
immune-mediated adverse events, intravenous high-dose corticosteroids 
should be administered based on the severity of the reaction. 
Tremelimumab-actl and durvalumab should be permanently discontinued 
for patients with grades 2, 3, or 4 myocarditis and should be discontinued 
for other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated adverse events 
when indicated (see prescribing information).  
POSEIDON, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed three different first-line 
treatment arms in 1013 patients with metastatic NSCLC who did not have 
EGFR or ALK mutations.877 The treatment arms included 1) tremelimumab 
plus durvalumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy; 2) durvalumab plus 
platinum-based chemotherapy; and 3) platinum-based chemotherapy 
alone; there were 675 patients in arms 1 and 3. The chemotherapy 
regimens included 1) tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus albumin-bound 
paclitaxel plus carboplatin for either nonsquamous NSCLC or squamous 
cell histology; 2) tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus pemetrexed plus 
either cisplatin or carboplatin for nonsquamous NSCLC; or 3) 
tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus gemcitabine plus either cisplatin or 
carboplatin for squamous cell histology. Most patients received the 
pemetrexed regimen. Most patients either currently smoked cigarettes 
(25%) or had previously smoked (57%). The median overall survival was 
14 months (95% CI, 11.7–16.1) in patients receiving tremelimumab plus 
durvalumab plus chemotherapy versus 11.7 months (95% CI, 10.5–13.1) 
in patients receiving chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–0.92; 
P=.003). Subgroup analysis showed that overall survival was similar 
between the groups for squamous cell histology and other subgroups.  
In patients receiving tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus chemotherapy, 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events included neutropenia, anemia, leukopenia,
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 184 ===
lymphocytopenia, increased lipase levels, hyponatremia, and 
thrombocytopenia.877 Common serious adverse events in patients 
receiving tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus chemotherapy included 
pneumonia (11%), anemia (5%), diarrhea (2.4%), thrombocytopenia 
(2.4%), pyrexia (2.4%), and febrile neutropenia (2.1%). Grade 3 to 4 
immune-related adverse events occurred in 10% of patients receiving 
tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus chemotherapy versus 1.5% of those 
receiving chemotherapy alone. Treatment-related deaths occurred in 3.3% 
(11/330) of patients receiving tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus 
chemotherapy and 2.4% (8/333) receiving chemotherapy alone. An 
exploratory analysis suggests that tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus 
chemotherapy may be beneficial in patients with metastatic NSCLC who 
have STK11, KEAP1, or KRAS mutations; however, the sample size was 
too small to yield definitive conclusions.878 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends tremelimumab-actl plus 
durvalumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy regimens as first-line 
therapy options for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC—regardless of 
histology or PD-L1 levels, and with negative test results for actionable 
driver mutations—based on clinical trial data and FDA approval; 
maintenance therapy with durvalumab with or without pemetrexed is also 
recommended.877 Combination therapy with tremelimumab-actl plus 
durvalumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy may be used as a first-line 
or subsequent therapy option, although it is not a preferred option, in 
eligible patients with actionable driver mutations as shown in the 
algorithm. Targeted therapy is a preferred first-line therapy option for 
patients with actionable driver mutations, except for EGFR exon 20 
mutations or KRAS mutations. The category assignment (ie, category 1, 
2A, or 2B) for the tremelimumab-actl plus durvalumab plus platinum-based 
chemotherapy regimens varies depending on the histology, 
chemotherapy, and PD-L1 levels. The NCCN Panel has preference 
stratified the tremelimumab actl plus durvalumab plus chemotherapy
regimens and decided that they are other recommended first-line therapy 
options for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial 
data.877  
Maintenance Therapy  
Maintenance therapy refers to therapy given for patients with advanced 
NSCLC after 4 to 6 cycles of first-line therapy.879 Patients are only 
candidates for maintenance therapy if their tumors have responded to their 
previous treatment or they have stable disease and their tumors have not 
progressed. Continuation maintenance therapy refers to the use of at least 
one of the agents that was given in the first-line regimen. Switch 
maintenance therapy refers to the initiation of a different agent that was 
not included as part of the first-line regimen. Selection of appropriate 
maintenance therapy depends on several factors, such as histologic type, 
presence of mutations or gene fusions, and PS. Maintenance therapy is 
recommended in the NCCN Guidelines for select patients with tumor 
response or stable disease and is not recommended for all patients; it is 
not recommended for patients with PS 3 to 4 or those with progression 
(see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).880 Monitoring is recommended 
during maintenance therapy with response assessment with CT, with or 
without contrast, of known or high-risk sites of disease every 6 to 12 
weeks.  
Continuation Maintenance Therapy 
For continuation maintenance therapy, select agents (which were initially 
given with first-line therapy) may be continued until evidence of disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity based on the design of the clinical 
trials that led to their approval. This section mainly discusses continuation 
maintenance with chemotherapy; continuation maintenance with ICIs is 
discussed in another section (see Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in this 
Discussion). Use of continuation maintenance therapy depends on several 
factors, such as whether the patient had minimal toxicity during treatment.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 185 ===
A drug vacation may be more appropriate for some patients.810 Some 
clinicians feel that continuation maintenance therapy is only appropriate 
for select patients, because it has only been shown to improve overall 
survival or quality of life for a few agents and not all agents, although it 
has been shown to improve PFS.808,810 In addition, maintenance therapy 
has not been shown to be superior to subsequent therapy, which is 
initiated at disease progression. A phase 3 randomized trial suggests that 
conventional cytotoxic agents should not be continued beyond 4 to 6 
cycles of therapy; however, many patients assigned to a longer duration of 
therapy did not receive the planned number of cycles (see Maintenance 
Therapy in this Discussion).807,808  
PARAMOUNT, a phase 3 randomized trial, reported that continuation 
maintenance therapy with pemetrexed slightly increased PFS when 
compared with placebo (4.1 vs. 2.8 months).881 Updated results from 
PARAMOUNT reported that continuation maintenance therapy with 
pemetrexed also improves overall survival (13.9 vs. 11.0 months).882 The 
NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends single-agent pemetrexed as 
continuation maintenance therapy (category 1) in patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.881-883  
POINTBREAK, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed bevacizumab plus 
carboplatin plus pemetrexed compared with bevacizumab plus carboplatin 
plus paclitaxel in patients with metastatic NSCLC; patients received 
maintenance therapy with either bevacizumab plus pemetrexed or 
bevacizumab alone.812 PFS was 6 months with pemetrexed plus 
carboplatin plus bevacizumab versus 5.6 months with paclitaxel plus 
carboplatin plus bevacizumab.812 It is important to note that the 
pemetrexed-based arm was associated with less toxicity (eg, less 
neurotoxicity, less neutropenia, less hair loss) than the paclitaxel-based 
arm. AVAPERL, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed maintenance 
therapy with bevacizumab plus pemetrexed versus bevacizumab alone in 
patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC; the initial regimen was 
bevacizumab plus cisplatin plus pemetrexed.884,885 An updated analysis 
reported that overall survival was 17.1 months with bevacizumab plus 
pemetrexed maintenance versus 13.2 months with bevacizumab alone 
(HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.63–1.21; P = .29).884 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends continuation maintenance therapy 
with bevacizumab plus pemetrexed in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC 
who initially received bevacizumab plus pemetrexed plus platinum 
regimen based on clinical trial data.884,885 Single-agent bevacizumab 
(category 1) may be continued beyond 4 to 6 cycles of initial therapy (ie, 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy given with bevacizumab) in patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC.806,883,886 The Panel recommends that 
bevacizumab biosimilars may be used in any of the systemic therapy 
regimens containing bevacizumab (eg, carboplatin plus paclitaxel plus 
bevacizumab) that are used for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC 
based on clinical data and FDA approvals.833,846-849 Therefore, if a 
bevacizumab biosimilar was initially used as part of first-line combination 
therapy, the biosimilar should be continued as maintenance therapy in 
eligible patients.  
IFCT-GFPC 0502, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared using 
maintenance therapy with either gemcitabine or erlotinib after first-line 
therapy with cisplatin-gemcitabine in patients with advanced NSCLC. 
Continuation maintenance therapy with single-agent gemcitabine was 
reported to increase PFS to a greater extent (3.8 months) than switch 
maintenance therapy with erlotinib (2.9 months) when compared with 
observation (1.9 months).742,887 A phase 3 randomized trial from the 
CECOG assessed continuation maintenance therapy with gemcitabine 
versus best supportive care after an initial regimen of cisplatin plus 
gemcitabine.888 The data showed a slight difference in PFS but no 
difference in overall survival (13 vs. 11 months, respectively; P = .195).
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 186 ===
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends gemcitabine (category 2B) as 
continuation maintenance therapy regardless of histology in patients with 
metastatic NSCLC, negative test results for actionable driver mutations, 
and PD-L1 expression less than 1%.  
Switch Maintenance Therapy 
Issues have been raised about switch maintenance therapy, including the 
design of the trials, modest survival benefits, quality of life, and 
toxicity.810,889 Two phase 3 randomized trials reported a benefit in PFS and 
overall survival with the initiation of pemetrexed after first-line 
chemotherapy (4–6 cycles) in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC and no 
apparent disease progression.890,891 The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends switch maintenance therapy with pemetrexed in eligible 
patients with nonsquamous cell carcinoma; negative test results for 
actionable driver mutations, and PD-L1 expression less than 1% based 
on clinical trial data and FDA approval.891,892  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel does not recommend erlotinib as switch 
maintenance therapy (or as subsequent therapy) for patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC, good PS, and negative test results for actionable 
driver mutations based on results from IUNO, a randomized trial, and a 
revised indication from the FDA.893 The NCCN NSCLC Panel also does 
not recommend switch maintenance therapy with erlotinib in patients with 
squamous cell NSCLC, because overall survival and quality of life were 
not improved.742,894 A phase 3 trial assessed switch maintenance therapy 
with docetaxel given either immediately after gemcitabine plus carboplatin 
or delayed until progression in patients with advanced NSCLC; however, 
many patients in the delayed chemotherapy arm did not receive 
docetaxel.895 Previously, the panel deleted the recommendation for switch 
maintenance therapy with docetaxel for patients with squamous cell 
NSCLC because there are better options.895,896

Clinical Evaluation  
The workup and evaluation of incidental lung nodules—that are detected 
on imaging for other conditions—are described in the NSCLC algorithm 
(see Incidental Lung Nodules in this Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC). The cutoff thresholds are 6 mm for a positive scan result for 
incidental solid and subsolid lung nodules detected on chest CT based on 
the Fleischner criteria (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).91-95 As 
previously described, low-dose CT screening is recommended for 
asymptomatic select patients who are at high risk for lung cancer and 
management of any nodules detected in these patients is described 
elsewhere (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, 
available at www.NCCN.org).  
After patients are confirmed to have NSCLC based on a pathologic 
diagnosis, a clinical evaluation needs to be done (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). In patients with symptoms, the clinical stage is 
initially determined from disease history (ie, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, 
weight loss) and physical examination together with a limited battery of 
tests (see Initial Evaluation and Clinical Stage in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends that smoking 
cessation advice, counseling, and pharmacotherapy be provided to 
patients.49,899-901 After the clinical stage is determined, the patient is 
assigned to one of the pathways that are defined by the stage, specific 
subdivision of the particular stage, and location of the tumor. Note that for 
some patients, diagnosis, staging, and surgical resection are done during 
the same operative procedure. A multidisciplinary evaluation should be 
done before treatment.  
Additional Pretreatment Evaluation 
As previously noted, evaluation of the mediastinal nodes is a key step in 
further staging of the patient. FDG PET/CT scans can be used as an 
initial assessment of the hilar and mediastinal nodes (ie, to determine 
whether the N1, N2, or N3 nodes are positive for cancer, which is a key 
determinant of stage II and stage III disease); however, CT scans have 
known limitations for evaluating the extent of lymph node involvement in 
lung cancer.109,902-904 When compared with noninvasive staging methods 
(EBUS, EUS), surgical staging with mediastinoscopy is more appropriate 
for certain settings when evaluating mediastinal nodes; however, 
clinicians use both methods when staging patients.109 Thus, 
mediastinoscopy is encouraged as part of the initial evaluation, particularly 
if the results of imaging are not conclusive and the probability of 
mediastinal involvement is high (based on tumor size and location). 
Therefore, mediastinoscopy is appropriate for patients with T2 to T3 
lesions even if the FDG PET/CT scan does not suggest mediastinal node 
involvement.  
Mediastinoscopy may also be appropriate to confirm mediastinal node 
involvement in patients with a positive FDG PET/CT scan. Although 
mediastinal biopsy is generally preferred, the risks in selected patients 
may outweigh the benefits, such as patients who are medically inoperable. 
In patients with peripheral tumors (outer one third of the lung) less than 3 
cm, pathologic mediastinal lymph node evaluation is optional if the nodes 
are FDG PET/CT negative because there is a low likelihood of positive 
mediastinal nodes.905 Invasive mediastinal staging is recommended for 
central tumors. Mediastinal evaluation can be considered in patients with 
clinical stage IA disease (T1abc,N0). In patients with peripheral T2a, 
central T1abc, or T2a lesions with negative FDG PET/CT scans, the risk 
for mediastinal lymph node involvement is higher and mediastinoscopy 
and/or EUS-FNA and EBUS-TBNA are recommended. Dillemans et al 
have reported a selective mediastinoscopy strategy, proceeding straight to 
thoracotomy without mediastinoscopy for T1 peripheral tumors without 
enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes on preoperative CT.906 This strategy
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 189 ===
resulted in a 16% incidence of positive N2 nodes discovered only at the 
time of thoracotomy.  
For identifying N2 disease, chest CT scans had sensitivity and specificity 
rates of 69% and 71%, respectively. Using a chest CT scan plus 
mediastinoscopy was significantly more accurate (89% vs. 71%) than 
using a chest CT scan alone for identifying N2 disease. When using CT 
scans, node positivity is based on the size of the lymph nodes. Therefore, 
a CT scan will miss small metastases that do not result in node 
enlargement. To address this issue, Arita et al specifically examined lung 
cancer metastases in normal size mediastinal lymph nodes in 90 patients 
and found an incidence of 16% (14/90) false-negative chest CT scans with 
histologic identification of occult N2 or N3 disease.907 Bronchoscopy is 
used in diagnosis and local staging of both central and peripheral lung 
lesions and is recommended for pretreatment evaluation of stage I to IIIA 
tumors. In patients who present with a solitary pulmonary nodule where 
the suspicion of malignancy is high, surgical resection without prior 
invasive testing may be reasonable.  
As previously mentioned, CT scans have known limitations for evaluating 
the extent of lymph node involvement in lung cancer.902 PET scans have 
been used to help evaluate the extent of disease and to provide more 
accurate staging. The NCCN NSCLC Panel reviewed the diagnostic 
performance of CT and PET scans. The panel assessed studies that 
examined the sensitivity and specificity of chest CT scans for mediastinal 
lymph node staging.908 Depending on the clinical scenario, a sensitivity of 
40% to 65% and a specificity of 45% to 90% were reported.909 Because 
they detect tumor physiology, as opposed to anatomy, PET scans may be 
more sensitive than CT scans. Moreover, if postobstructive pneumonitis is 
present, there is little correlation between the size of the mediastinal lymph 
nodes and tumor involvement.910 Chin et al found that PET, when used to 
stage the mediastinal nodes, was 78% sensitive and 81% specific with a 
negative predictive value of 89%.911 Kernstine et al compared PET scan to 
CT scan for identifying N2 and N3 disease in NSCLC.912 The PET scan 
was found to be more sensitive than the CT scan in identifying mediastinal 
node disease (70% vs. 65%). FDG PET/CT has been shown to be useful 
in restaging patients after adjuvant therapy.913,914 When patients with 
early-stage disease are accurately staged using FDG PET/CT, 
inappropriate surgery is avoided.915 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel believes that PET scans can play a role in the 
evaluation and more accurate staging of NSCLC, for example, in 
identifying stage I (peripheral and central T1–2,N0), stage II, stage III, and 
stage IV diseases.109,916,917 However, FDG PET/CT is even more sensitive 
and is recommended by the panel.915,918,919 PET/CT is typically done from 
the skull base to the knees; whole body PET/CT may also be done.  
Positive FDG PET/CT scan findings for distant disease need pathologic or 
other radiologic confirmation (eg, MRI of bone). If the FDG PET/CT scan is 
positive in the mediastinum, the lymph node status needs pathologic 
confirmation.109,920 Transesophageal EUS-FNA and EBUS-TBNA have 
proven useful to stage patients or to diagnose mediastinal lesions; these 
techniques can be used instead of invasive staging procedures in select 
patients.921-924 When compared with CT and PET, EBUS-TBNA has a high 
sensitivity and specificity for staging mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes in 
patients with lung cancer.925 In patients with positive nodes on CT or PET, 
EBUS-TNBA can be used to clarify the results.926,927 In patients with 
negative findings on EBUS-TNBA, conventional mediastinoscopy can be 
done to confirm the results.922,927-929 Note that EBUS is also known as 
endosonography.  
The routine use of bone scans (to exclude bone metastases) is not 
recommended. Brain MRI with contrast is recommended to rule out 
asymptomatic brain metastases in patients with stage II, III, and IV disease if aggresive combined-modality therapy is being considered.
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 190 ===
Patients with stage IB NSCLC are less likely to have brain metastases; 
therefore, brain MRI is optional in this setting and can be considered for 
select patients at high risk (eg, tumors >5 cm, central location). If brain 
MRI cannot be done, then CT of the head with contrast is an option. Note 
that PET scans are not recommended for assessing whether brain 
metastases are present (see the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous 
System Cancers, available at www.NCCN.org).  
Initial Therapy 
As previously mentioned, accurate pathologic assessment and staging are 
essential before treatment for NSCLC, because management varies 
depending on the stage, histology, presence of genetic variants, and PS. 
Before treatment, it is strongly recommended that determination of tumor 
resectability be made by thoracic surgeons who perform lung cancer 
surgery as a prominent part of their practice (see Principles of Surgical 
Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). RT doses are provided in 
the algorithm (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). In addition, the NCCN Guidelines also 
recommend regimens for targeted therapy, immunotherapy, 
chemotherapy, and chemoradiation (see Perioperative Systemic Therapy, 
Concurrent Chemoradiation Regimens, Molecular and Biomarker-Directed 
Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease, and Systemic Therapy for 
Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). 
First-line targeted therapy options are recommended for eligible patients 
with metastatic NSCLC and positive test results for actionable driver 
mutations such as ALK, BRAF p.V600E, EGFR, METex14 skipping, 
NTRK1/2/3, RET, and ROS1. Second-line targeted therapy options are 
recommended for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC and positive 
test results for EGFR exon 20 insertions or KRAS p.G12C mutations. 
First-line immunotherapy options are recommended for eligible patients 
with metastatic NSCLC and negative test results for actionable driver mutations. Immunotherapy options may be used as first line or subsequent therapy options in eligible patients with actionable driver 
mutations as shown in the algorithm, although they are generally not 
preferred options.  
Stage I, Stage II, and Stage IIIA Disease 
Depending on the extent and type of comorbidity present, patients with 
stage I or a subset of stage II (T1–2,N1) tumors are generally candidates 
for surgical resection and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Definitive 
RT, preferably SABR, is recommended for patients with early-stage 
NSCLC who are medically inoperable or refuse surgery; RT can be 
considered as an alternative to surgery in patients at high risk of 
complications (see Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in this Discussion 
and see Initial Treatment for Stage I and II in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).384,405,408,483,547,931 Image-guided thermal ablation (eg, cryotherapy, 
microwave, RFA) is an option for selected patients who are medically 
inoperable and not receiving SABR or definitive RT (see Principles of 
Image-Guided Thermal Ablation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).384,551-557 In some instances, positive mediastinal nodes (N2) are 
discovered at surgery; in this setting, an additional assessment of staging 
and tumor resectability must be made, and the treatment (ie, inclusion of 
systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection) must be modified 
accordingly. Therefore, the NCCN Guidelines include two different tracks 
for T1–2,N2 disease (ie, stage IIIA disease): 1) T1–2,N2 disease 
discovered unexpectedly at surgical exploration; and 2) T1–2,N2 disease 
confirmed before thoracotomy. In the second case, an initial brain MRI 
with contrast and FDG PET/CT scan (if not previously done) are 
recommended to rule out metastatic disease.  
For patients with clinical stage IIB (T3,N0) and stage IIIA tumors who have 
different treatment options (surgery, RT, or chemotherapy), a 
multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended before treatment. For the 
subsets of stage IIB (T3,N0) and stage IIIA (T4,N0–1) tumors treatment

options are organized according to the location of the tumor, such as the 
superior sulcus, chest wall, proximal airway, or mediastinum.394 For each 
location, a thoracic surgeon needs to determine whether the tumor is 
resectable (see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). Preoperative concurrent chemoradiation followed by surgical 
resection of a superior sulcus tumor has shown 2-year survival in the 50% 
to 70% range.394,503,505,932-934 The overall 5-year survival rate is 
approximately 40%.503 For patients with resectable tumors (T3 
invasion,N0–1) in the superior sulcus, the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends preoperative concurrent chemoradiation followed by surgical 
resection and adjuvant chemotherapy plus either atezolizumab, 
pembrolizumab, or osimertinib, if patients have certain EGFR mutations or 
PD-L1 levels of 1% or more (see Initial Treatment for Superior Sulcus 
Tumors in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Patients with possibly 
resectable superior sulcus tumors should undergo preoperative concurrent 
chemoradiation before surgical re-evaluation (including CT with or without 
contrast ± PET/CT). For patients with unresectable tumors (T4 
extension,N0–1) in the superior sulcus, definitive concurrent 
chemoradiation is recommended followed by durvalumab (category 
1).781,935  
Definitive concurrent chemoradiation is recommended for patients with 
medically inoperable stage II or III NSCLC. The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends durvalumab (category 1) as a consolidation immunotherapy 
option for eligible patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC and without 
disease progression after treatment with definitive concurrent 
chemoradiation based on clinical trial data and FDA approval (see 
Chemoradiation in this Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).16,363,786 The panel also recommends durvalumab as a 
consolidation immunotherapy option (regardless of PD-L1 status) for 
eligible patients (PS 0–1) with unresectable stage II NSCLC but without 
disease progression after definitive concurrent platinum-based
chemoradiation. The recommendation for consolidation immunotherapy 
with durvalumab occurs in multiple places in the NCCN Guidelines.  
Surgical resection is the preferred treatment option for patients with 
tumors of the chest wall, proximal airway, or mediastinum (T3–4,N0–1). 
Other treatment options include preoperative systemic therapy or 
concurrent chemoradiation before surgical resection. For unresectable 
tumors (T4,N0–1) without pleural effusion, definitive concurrent 
chemoradiation (category 1) is recommended followed by consolidation 
immunotherapy with durvalumab (category 1).16,447,702,786 Additional 
chemotherapy (ie, consolidation chemotherapy) is an option if patients 
will not be receiving durvalumab.532,778 However, consolidation 
chemotherapy is not recommended if patients will be receiving 
durvalumab, based on concerns that consolidation chemotherapy will 
increase the risk of pneumonitis if patients are also receiving 
durvalumab.  
Multimodality therapy is recommended for most patients with stage III 
NSCLC.774 For patients with stage IIIA disease and positive mediastinal 
nodes (T1–2,N2), treatment is based on the findings of pathologic 
mediastinal lymph node evaluation (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). Patients with negative mediastinal biopsy findings are 
candidates for surgery. For those patients with resectable lesions, 
mediastinal lymph node dissection or lymph node sampling should be 
performed during the operation. Those individuals who are medically 
inoperable should be treated according to their clinical stage. For patients 
with (T1–2) N2 node-positive disease, a brain MRI with contrast and FDG 
PET/CT scan (if not done previously) are recommended to search for 
distant metastases. When distant metastases are not present, the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends that the patient be treated with definitive 
concurrent chemoradiation therapy.482,703 Recommended therapy for

metastatic disease depends on whether disease is in a solitary site or is 
widespread.  
When a lung metastasis is present, it usually occurs in a patient with other 
systemic metastases; the prognosis is poor. Therefore, many of these 
patients are not candidates for surgery; however, systemic therapy is 
recommended. Although uncommon, patients with lung metastases but 
without systemic metastases have a better prognosis and are candidates 
for surgery (see Multiple Lung Cancers in this Discussion).936 Patients with 
separate pulmonary nodule(s) in the same lobe (T3,N0–1) or ipsilateral 
non-primary lobe (T4,N0–1), without other systemic metastases, are 
potentially curable by surgery; 5-year survival rates are about 30%.937 For 
those with N2 nodes after surgery, concurrent chemoradiation is 
recommended for those with positive margins and an R2 resection; either 
sequential or concurrent chemoradiation is recommended after an R1 
resection. Most NCCN Member Institutions favor concurrent 
chemoradiation for positive margins, but sequential chemoradiation is 
reasonable in frailer patients.768 For those with N2 nodes and negative 
margins, l chemotherapy (category 1) or sequential chemotherapy with RT 
is recommended. Adjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant 
atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, or osimertinib is recommended for those 
with N0–1, depending on EGFR mutation levels and PD-L1 levels (see the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). In patients with synchronous solitary 
nodules (contralateral lung), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
treating them as two primary lung tumors if both are curable, even if the 
histology of the two tumors is similar.938  
Multiple Lung Cancers  
Patients with a history of lung cancer or those with biopsy-proven 
synchronous lesions may be suspected of or confirmed with having 
multiple lung cancers.939,940 It is important to determine whether the 
multiple lung cancers are metastases or separate lung primaries
(synchronous or metachronous); most multiple lung tumors are 
metastases.86,394,941,942 Lesions with different cell types, such as squamous 
cell or adenocarcinoma, are usually different primary tumors. However, 
lesions of the same cell type may not be metastases. Therefore, it is 
essential to determine the histology of the lung tumor (see Principles of 
Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Infection and 
other benign diseases also need to be ruled out (eg, inflammatory 
granulomas).943,944 Although criteria have been established for diagnosing 
multiple lung cancers, no definitive method has been established before 
treatment.944-947 The Martini and Melamed criteria are often used to 
diagnose multiple lung cancers as follows: 1) the histologies are different; 
or 2) the histologies are the same, but there is no lymph node involvement 
and no extrathoracic metastases.947 Data suggest that NGS testing may 
help determine whether separate lung nodules are clonally related.948-950  
Broad molecular profiling can be used to assess multiple lung lesions 
(see Summary of the Guidelines Updates in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). For example, tumors with non-overlapping, unique mutations 
are considered to be clonally unrelated, separate primary lung cancers 
even if they are histologically similar. Therefore, these tumors can be 
treated with local therapy (see Multiple Lung Cancers in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Treatment of multiple lung cancers depends on 
the status of the lymph nodes (eg, N0–1) and on whether patients are 
asymptomatic, symptomatic, or at high or low risk of becoming 
symptomatic.941,951-953 Patients should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary 
setting by thoracic surgeons, pulmonary medicine, radiation oncologists, 
and medical oncologists. In patients eligible for definitive local therapy, 
parenchymal-sparing resection is preferred (see the Principles of Surgical 
Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).940,941 VATS or SABR are 
reasonable options depending on the number and distribution of the 
tumors requiring local treatment.954 Multiple lung nodules (eg, solid, 
subsolid nodules) may also be detected on CT scans; some of these
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 193 ===
nodules can be followed with imaging, whereas others need to be biopsied 
or excised (see Incidental Lung Nodules in this Discussion and the NCCN 
Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, available at www.NCCN.org).955  
For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel revised the 
algorithm for multiple lung cancers. For example, the NCCN Panel added 
an initial recommendation for multidisciplinary evaluation for patients 
suspected of or confirmed with having multiple lung cancers. One of the 
goals during multidisciplinary evaluation for multiple lung cancers is to 
assess whether patients have lung nodules that can be observed instead 
of erroneously assuming that patients have stage IV NSCLC. The panel 
added the following caveats: lesions at low risk of becoming symptomatic 
can be observed, such as small subsolid nodules with slow growth. 
However, treatment should be considered if the lesion(s) show 
accelerating growth, increasing solid component, or increasing FDG 
uptake, even if the lesions are small.  
Stage IIIB and IIIC NSCLC  
Stage IIIB NSCLC comprises two unresectable groups, including: 1) T1–
2,N3 tumors; and 2) T3–4,N2 tumors; stage IIIC NSCLC includes T3,N3 
and contralateral mediastinal nodes (T4,N3), which are also unresectable. 
Surgical resection is not recommended in patients with T1–2,N3 disease. 
However, in patients with suspected N3 disease, the NCCN Guidelines 
recommend pathologic confirmation of nodal status (see Pretreatment 
Evaluation in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).956,957 In addition, FDG 
PET/CT scans (if not previously done) and brain MRI with contrast should 
also be included in the pretreatment evaluation. If these imaging tests are 
negative, then treatment options for the appropriate nodal status should be 
followed (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). If N3 disease is 
confirmed, definitive concurrent chemoradiation (category 1) is 
recommended followed by durvalumab (category 1).447,702,781,786,958-960  
Durvalumab is recommended (category 1) as a consolidation 
immunotherapy option for eligible patients with unresectable stage III 
NSCLC and without disease progression after treatment with definitive 
concurrent chemoradiation (see Chemoradiation in this Discussion and 
the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).16,363,786 If patients will be receiving 
durvalumab, additional f chemotherapy (ie, consolidation chemotherapy) 
is not recommended based on concerns that adding consolidation 
chemotherapy will increase the risk of pneumonitis if patients are also 
receiving durvalumab. If patients will not be receiving durvalumab 
because of medical contraindications or other reasons, consolidation 
chemotherapy is an option after concurrent chemoradiation.532,778 For 
metastatic disease that is confirmed by FDG PET/CT scan and brain MRI 
with contrast, treatment is described in the NCCN Guidelines for limited or 
metastatic disease.  
For patients with T4,N2–3 disease (stages IIIB and IIIC), surgical resection 
is not recommended. The initial workup includes biopsies of the N3 and 
N2 nodes. If these biopsies are negative, the same treatment options may 
be used as for stage IIIA (T4,N0–1) disease (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). If either the contralateral or ipsilateral mediastinal node is 
positive, definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy is recommended 
(category 1) followed by durvalumab (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).447,702,781,786,958-961 Again, durvalumab is recommended (category 
1) as a consolidation immunotherapy option for eligible patients with 
unresectable stage III NSCLC and without disease progression after 
treatment with definitive concurrent chemoradiation.16,363,786 Consolidation 
chemotherapy is an option for eligible patients.532,778 However, 
consolidation chemotherapy is not recommended if patients will be 
receiving durvalumab.

=== PAGE 194 ===
Limited Metastatic Disease  
In general, systemic therapy is recommended for patients with metastatic 
disease (see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).962 In addition, palliative treatment, including 
RT, may be needed during the disease course to treat localized 
symptoms, diffuse brain metastases, or bone metastases (see Therapy for 
Recurrence and Metastasis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). This 
section focuses on patients with limited metastatic disease; management 
of widespread distant metastases is described in another section (see 
Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Biomarker testing is recommended for patients 
with stage IVA disease (see Predictive and Prognostic Biomarkers in this 
Discussion).  
Pleural or pericardial effusion is a criterion for stage IV, M1a disease. T4 
with pleural effusion is classified as stage IV, M1a (see Table 3 in Staging 
in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).158 Pleural or pericardial effusions are 
malignant in 90% to 95% of patients; however, they may be related to 
obstructive pneumonitis, atelectasis, lymphatic or venous obstruction, or a 
pulmonary embolus. Therefore, pathologic confirmation of a malignant 
effusion by using thoracentesis or pericardiocentesis is recommended. In 
certain cases where thoracentesis is inconclusive, thoracoscopy may be 
performed. In the absence of nonmalignant causes (eg, obstructive 
pneumonia), an exudate or sanguineous effusion is considered malignant 
regardless of the results of cytologic examination. If the pleural or 
pericardial effusion is considered negative for malignancy (M0), 
recommended treatment is based on the confirmed T and N stage (see 
the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Data suggest that most pleural or 
pericardial effusions are associated with unresectable disease in 95% of 
cases.963 In patients with effusions that are positive for malignancy, the 
tumor is defined as M1a and is treated with local therapy (ie, ambulatory 
small catheter drainage, pleurodesis, and pericardial window) in addition 
to treatment as for stage IV disease.964,965  
Care of patients with distant metastases in limited sites (ie, stage 
IVA,M1b) and good PS depends on the location and number of the 
metastases; the diagnosis is aided by mediastinoscopy, bronchoscopy, 
FDG PET/CT scan, and brain MRI with contrast. The increased sensitivity 
of FDG PET/CT scans, compared with other imaging methods, may 
identify additional metastases and, thus, spare some patients from 
unnecessary futile surgery. Positive FDG PET/CT scan findings for distant 
disease need pathologic or other radiologic confirmation. If the FDG 
PET/CT scan is positive in the mediastinum, the lymph node status needs 
pathologic confirmation. Patients with oligometastatic disease (eg, brain 
metastases) and otherwise limited disease in the chest may benefit from 
aggressive local therapy to both the primary chest and metastatic 
sites.584,966 Aggressive local therapy may comprise surgery and/or 
definitive RT, including SRS and SABR, and may be preceded or followed 
by chemotherapy. After progression on TKIs, patients with EGFR 
mutation–positive metastatic NSCLC may be able to continue with their 
current TKIs; local therapy can be considered to treat their limited 
progression (eg, SRS to brain metastases or other sites, SABR for limited 
thoracic or other metastatic disease; surgery).967,968  
Neoadjuvant or Adjuvant Therapy  
Chemotherapy, Chemoradiation, Immunotherapy, and Targeted 
Therapy 
On the basis of clinical studies,690-692 the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends cisplatin combined with docetaxel, etoposide, gemcitabine, 
or vinorelbine as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy options (also known as 
perioperative therapy) for all histologies in eligible patients with locally 
advanced disease. The NCCN NSCLC Panel has preference stratified all 
the systemic therapy regimens and decided that cisplatin plus
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 195 ===
pemetrexed is a preferred neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy option (also 
known as preoperative and postoperative therapy) for nonsquamous 
NSCLC, whereas cisplatin plus either gemcitabine or docetaxel is 
preferred for squamous cell NSCLC (see Perioperative Systemic Therapy 
in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).738,743,790 Cisplatin combined with 
either vinorelbine or etoposide are “other recommended” options. For 
patients with comorbidities or those who cannot tolerate cisplatin, 
carboplatin may be combined with pemetrexed (nonsquamous only), 
paclitaxel, or gemcitabine; thus, these regimens are useful in certain 
circumstances.738,969 These neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimens may also 
be used for sequential chemoradiation.744-747  
Because patients with stage III disease have both local and distant 
failures, theoretically, the use of chemotherapy may eradicate 
micrometastatic disease obviously present but undetectable at diagnosis. 
The timing of this chemotherapy varies (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). Such chemotherapy may be given alone, sequentially, or 
concurrently with RT. In addition, chemotherapy could be given 
preoperatively or postoperatively in appropriate patients. Three phase 3 
trials have assessed preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery 
compared with surgery alone in the treatment of stage III NSCLC.697,970-972 
All three studies showed a survival advantage for patients who received 
preoperative chemotherapy. SWOG S9900—one of the largest 
randomized trials examining preoperative chemotherapy in early-stage 
NSCLC—assessed surgery alone compared with surgery plus 
preoperative paclitaxel plus carboplatin in patients with stage IB/IIA and 
stage IIB/IIIA NSCLC (excluding superior sulcus tumors). PFS and overall 
survival were improved with preoperative chemotherapy.971,972 The two 
earlier phase 3 studies had a small number of patients, while the SWOG 
study was stopped early because of the positive results of the IALT study. 
A number of phase 2 studies have evaluated preoperative chemotherapy 
for stage III NSCLC with (or without) RT followed by surgery 973-975
Post-surgical treatment options for patients with stage IA tumors 
(T1abc,N0) and with positive surgical margins (R1, R2) include 
re-resection (preferred) or RT (category 2B); observation is recommended 
for patients with negative surgical margins (R0). Postoperative 
chemotherapy is a recommended option for patients with T2ab,N0 tumors 
and negative surgical margins who have high-risk features, including 
poorly differentiated tumors, vascular invasion, wedge resection, visceral 
pleural involvement, and unknown lymph node status (Nx) (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).737,976 If the surgical margins are positive in patients 
with T2ab,N0 tumors, options include: 1) re-resection (preferred) with (or 
without) chemotherapy; or 2) RT with (or without) chemotherapy 
(chemotherapy is an option for T2b,N0).467,737  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends atezolizumab as an adjuvant 
therapy option for eligible patients with completely resected (R0) stage 
IIB to IIIA, stage IIIB (only T3,N2), or high-risk stage IIA NSCLC and 
PD-L1 of 1% or more, and negative for EGFR exon 19 deletions, EGFR 
L858R mutations, or ALK rearrangements, who have previously received 
adjuvant chemotherapy based on clinical trial data and FDA approval 
(see Surgery Followed by Adjuvant Therapy: Trial Data and NCCN 
Recommendations in this Discussion).750 For the 2023 update (Version 
2), the NCCN Panel also recommends pembrolizumab as an adjuvant 
therapy option following adjuvant chemotherapy for eligible patients with 
completely resected early-stage NSCLC based on clinical trial data and 
FDA approval.751 The panel recommends osimertinib as an adjuvant 
therapy option for eligible patients with completely resected (R0) stage IB 
to IIIA or stage IIIB (only T3,N2) NSCLC and EGFR exon 19 deletions or 
EGFR L858R mutations who have previously received adjuvant 
chemotherapy or are ineligible to receive platinum-based chemotherapy 
based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.748 For patients who have 
these EGFR mutations and PD-L1 levels of 1% or more, the panel only 
recommends osimertinib; the panel does not recommend using 1)

=== PAGE 196 ===
single-agent therapy with either atezolizumab or pembrolizumab; or 2) 
combination therapy with osimertinib plus atezolizumab or 
pembrolizumab.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends adjuvant chemotherapy (category 
1) followed by atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, or osimertinib for eligible 
patients with the appropriate biomarkers, negative surgical margins, and 
stage IIB disease, including 1) T1abc–T2a,N1; 2) T2b,N1; or 3) T3,N0 
disease.733,977 If surgical margins are positive in these patients, options 
after an R1 resection include: 1) re-resection and chemotherapy; or 2) 
chemoradiation (either sequential or concurrent). After an R2 resection, 
options include: 1) re-resection and chemotherapy; or 2) concurrent 
chemoradiation. Most NCCN Member Institutions favor concurrent 
chemoradiation for positive margins, but sequential chemoradiation is 
reasonable in frailer patients.768 Postoperative chemotherapy or 
chemoradiation can also be used in patients with stage III NSCLC who 
have had surgery (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Patients with 
T1–3,N2 or T3,N1 disease (discovered only at surgical exploration and 
mediastinal lymph node dissection) and positive margins may be treated 
with chemoradiation; either sequential or concurrent chemoradiation is 
recommended for an R1 resection, whereas concurrent chemoradiation is 
recommended for an R2 resection. For patients with negative margins 
(R0), treatment options include either 1) chemotherapy (category 1) 
followed by atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, or osimertinib for eligible 
patients with the appropriate biomarkers; or 2) sequential chemotherapy 
and consider RT.733  
For stage IIIA superior sulcus tumors (T4 extension,N0–1) that become 
resectable after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation, resection 
followed by chemotherapy is recommended and then atezolizumab, 
pembrolizumab, or osimertinib, depending on biomarker status (see the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Surgical reevaluation (including chest CT 
with or without contrast and with or without PET/CT) is done to determine 
whether the tumor is resectable after treatment. If the lesion remains 
unresectable after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation, then 
completion of definitive dose chemoradiation without interruption, followed 
by consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab (category 1) is 
recommended for eligible patients. Among patients with chest wall lesions 
with T3 invasion–T4 extension, N0–1 disease, those who are initially 
treated with surgery (preferred) may receive chemotherapy and then either 
atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, or osimertinib depending on biomarker 
status, if the surgical margins are negative. For patients with positive 
margins, options include either 1) sequential or concurrent 
chemoradiation; or 2) re-resection and chemotherapy. As previously 
mentioned, most NCCN Member Institutions favor concurrent 
chemoradiation for positive margins, but sequential is reasonable in frailer 
patients.768 Similar treatment plans are recommended for resectable 
tumors of the proximal airway or mediastinum (T3–4,N0–1).  
For patients with stage III disease and positive mediastinal nodes (T1–
3,N2) and no apparent disease progression after initial treatment with 
induction systemic therapy with or without RT, surgery is recommended 
(see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).450 Alternatively, if the disease 
progresses, treatment options include either 1) local therapy using RT (if 
feasible) with (or without) chemotherapy; or 2) systemic therapy. In 
patients with separate pulmonary nodules in the same lobe (T3,N0–1) or 
ipsilateral non-primary lobe (T4,N0–1), surgery is recommended; 
neoadjuvant systemic therapy with nivolumab plus chemotherapy is an 
option before surgery. In patients with N2 disease and negative margins, 
options include 1) chemotherapy (category 1); or 2) sequential 
chemotherapy with radiation. If the resection margins are positive in 
patients with N2 disease, concurrent chemoradiation is recommended for 
an R2 resection, whereas either concurrent or sequential chemoradiation
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 197 ===
is recommended for an R1 resection. Concurrent chemoradiation is often 
used for positive margins, but sequential is reasonable in frailer patients.  
Radiation Therapy 
After complete resection of clinical early-stage NSCLC, postoperative RT 
has been found to be detrimental for pathologic N0 or N1 stage disease in 
a meta-analysis (population-based analysis of data from SEER) of small 
randomized trials using older techniques and dosing regimens.978 Data 
from two randomized phase 3 trials, the LungART and PORT-C trials, 
show that postoperative RT (also known as PORT) did not improve 
survival compared with no postoperative RT, although locoregional 
control was significantly improved in patients with completely resected 
stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
chemotherapy.450,453 Postoperative RT may be considered for select 
patients with negative margins and high-risk N2 disease (see 
Chemoradiation in this Discussion and Principles of Radiation Therapy in 
the algorithm). Previous trials and meta-analyses had suggested that 
there was an apparent survival benefit of postoperative RT in patients with 
N2 nodal stage diagnosed surgically.467,574,977,979,980  
PROCLAIM, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed concurrent thoracic RT 
with cisplatin plus pemetrexed versus cisplatin plus etoposide followed by 
consolidation chemotherapy in patients with unresectable stage III 
nonsquamous NSCLC.778 Both regimens were equivalent in terms of 
survival, but the cisplatin plus pemetrexed regimen was associated with 
less neutropenia (24.4% vs. 44.5%; P < .001) and fewer grade 3 to 4 
adverse events (64.0% vs. 76.8%; P = .001). The NCCN Panel has 
preference stratified the concurrent chemoradiation regimens and decided 
that pemetrexed with either carboplatin or cisplatin are preferred 
concurrent chemoradiation regimens for eligible patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC.783,981,982 Other preferred concurrent chemoradiation 
regimens include 1) paclitaxel plus carboplatin; and 2) cisplatin plus
etoposide;, these regimens may be used regardless of histology.532,780 The 
NCCN NSCLC Panel deleted the cisplatin plus etoposide consolidation 
regimen based on the PROCLAIM trial.778 Other consolidation 
chemotherapy regimens are an option for eligible patients receiving 
definitive chemoradiation; however, consolidation chemotherapy is not 
recommended if the patient will be receiving durvalumab.  
Postoperative chemotherapy (category 1) followed by adjuvant 
atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, or osimertinib, depending on the biomarker 
status, is recommended for patients with T1–3, N2 disease and negative 
margins (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Postoperative sequential 
chemotherapy with consideration of postoperative RT is recommended for 
select patients with negative margins and high-risk N2 disease such as 
extracapsular extension, multistation involvement, inadequate lymph node 
dissection or sampling, and/or refusal or intolerance of adjuvant systemic 
therapy.450,453,767 Either concurrent or sequential chemoradiation may be 
used for postoperative therapy and positive margins, depending on the 
type of resection and the setting (eg, N2 disease). Concurrent 
chemoradiation is recommended for R2 resections, whereas either 
sequential or concurrent chemoradiation is recommended for R1 
resections. Concurrent chemoradiation is often used for positive margins, 
but sequential is reasonable in frailer patients.768 Cisplatin plus etoposide 
and carboplatin plus paclitaxel are chemoradiation regimens 
recommended by the NCCN NSCLC Panel for all histologies (see 
Concurrent Chemoradiation Regimens in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).780 When chemoradiation is recommended in the NCCN 
Guidelines, these regimens may be used for stage II to III 
disease.468,469,702,703,781,784,785  
Surveillance  
Because recurrence is common after treatment for NSCLC, surveillance is 
recommended in the NCCN Guidelines for eligible patients with no
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 198 ===
evidence of clinical or radiographic disease after definitive therapy. Data 
from randomized phase 3 trials are not available to clarify surveillance 
recommendations; therefore, the most appropriate schedules are 
controversial.983-988 The surveillance recommendations were compiled by 
polling the NCCN NSCLC Panel regarding their practice patterns. Details 
regarding the specific surveillance schedules are outlined in the algorithm 
based on stage and the definitive treatment (see Surveillance After 
Completion of Definitive Therapy in the algorithm). Surveillance schedules 
for most patients with metastatic disease are individualized for each 
patient, although the NCCN Guidelines provide a surveillance schedule for 
certain patients with stage IV oligometastatic disease.  
NLST, a large randomized trial, assessed lung screening with low-dose 
CT screening versus chest radiography in individuals at high risk for lung 
cancer.73 Low-dose CT screening decreased mortality from lung cancer 
(mainly adenocarcinoma) compared with chest radiography (247 vs. 309 
deaths, respectively; 20% relative reduction in mortality; 95% CI, 6.8–26.7; 
P = .004).73 Low-dose CT is recommended for screening individuals at 
high risk for lung cancer (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer 
Screening, available at www.NCCN.org). The NCCN NSCLC Panel feels 
that low-dose CT is beneficial for identifying recurrences in patients 
previously treated for NSCLC. It is important to note that the surveillance 
recommendations for patients who have been treated for NSCLC are 
different from the screening recommendations for individuals at high risk 
for lung cancer (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening).  
The NCCN Guidelines recommend a chest CT scan with (or without) 
contrast and an H&P for the initial surveillance schedules (2–5 years after 
definitive treatment) followed by annual low-dose non-contrast–enhanced 
CT and an H&P (see Surveillance After Completion of Definitive Therapy 
in the algorithm).986,987,989-992 Patients treated with chemotherapy with (or 
without) RT who have residual abnormalities may require more frequent 
imaging. FDG PET/CT or brain MRI is not routinely recommended for 
routine surveillance in patients without symptoms.983 But, PET may be 
useful for assessing CT scans that appear to show malignant neoplasms 
but may be radiation fibrosis, atelectasis, or other benign conditions. Areas 
previously treated with RT may remain FDG avid for up to 2 years; 
therefore, histologic confirmation of suspicious areas with apparent 
“recurrent” disease is needed.993 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
assessing patients with recurrences using PET/CT and brain MRI with 
contrast; if brain MRI is not possible, then CT with contrast of the head is 
recommended. Information about smoking cessation (eg, advice, 
counseling, therapy) should be provided for patients undergoing 
surveillance to improve their quality of life. 
The NCCN Guidelines include information about the long-term follow-up 
care of NSCLC survivors (see Cancer Survivorship Care in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). These recommendations include guidelines for 
routine cancer surveillance, immunizations, health monitoring, counseling 
for wellness and health promotion, and cancer screening (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer Screening, NCCN Guidelines for Breast 
Cancer Screening and Diagnosis, and NCCN Guidelines for Prostate 
Cancer Early Detection, available at www.NCCN.org). An analysis 
suggests that patients who survive lung cancer have a high symptom 
burden 1 year after diagnosis and therefore need management after 
treatment.994  
Treatment of Recurrences and Distant Metastases 
Recurrences are subdivided into locoregional recurrences and distant 
metastases. Management of locoregional recurrences or symptomatic 
local disease—endobronchial obstruction, mediastinal lymph node 
recurrence, superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction, and severe 
hemoptysis—is described in the NCCN Guidelines (see Therapy for 
Recurrence and Metastasis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). An
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 199 ===
SVC stent may be used with either concurrent chemoradiation or RT to 
treat SVC obstruction. For patients with endobronchial obstruction, 
relieving airway obstruction may increase survival, especially in patients 
who are severely compromised, and may improve their quality of life.995 
After treatment for locoregional recurrence, observation or systemic 
therapy (category 2B for systemic therapy) is recommended if 
disseminated disease is not evident. Systemic therapy is recommended 
for disseminated disease. The type of systemic therapy depends on the 
histologic type, whether somatic genomic alterations are present that can 
be treated with targeted therapy, and PS (see Systemic Therapy for 
Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
Management of distant metastases—localized symptoms; bone; and 
limited, diffuse brain, or disseminated metastases—is described in the 
NCCN Guidelines (see Therapy for Recurrence and Metastasis in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Palliation of symptoms throughout the 
disease course can be achieved with external-beam RT for distant 
metastases with localized symptoms, diffuse brain metastases, or bone 
metastases (bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy can be 
considered).480,579,996 For patients at risk of fracture in weight-bearing bone, 
orthopedic stabilization and palliative RT are recommended.  
Of note, recurrent and metastatic disease have historically been regarded 
as incurable. However, select limited locoregional recurrences may be 
treated with curative intent therapy (re-resection preferred or RT or SABR) 
(see Therapy for Recurrence and Metastasis in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). Similarly, patients with limited-site oligometastatic disease and 
good PS may benefit from aggressive local therapies to the metastatic and 
primary sites, with clinical data suggesting the possibility of long-term 
survival (see Initial Treatment for Stage IVA, M1b in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC).607,608,611,654,997-1000 In addition, emerging clinical data suggest 
the feasibility of definitive reirradiation of local recurrences within prior RT 
fields using highly conformal techniques, although this should be limited to 
highly selected cases in specialty centers with appropriate expertise 
because of the potential for severe toxicity with high cumulative radiation 
doses to critical structures.477,631-633,1001-1004  
In patients with NSCLC who have bone metastases, data suggest that 
denosumab increases median overall survival when compared with 
zoledronic acid (9.5 vs. 8 months).1005 The FDA has approved the use of 
zoledronic acid and denosumab in patients with bone metastases from 
solid tumors.1006,1007 Denosumab and bisphosphonate therapy can be 
associated with severe hypocalcemia; patients with hypoparathyroidism 
and vitamin D deficiency are at increased risk for hypocalcemia. 
Denosumab or intravenous bisphosphonate therapy can be considered in 
patients with bone metastases to decrease bone complications (eg, 
decrease pain, delay skeletal-related events) based on clinical trial 
data.

Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC 
For patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, the NCCN Guidelines 
recommend that histologic subtype should be determined before therapy 
so that an appropriate treatment can be selected. Smoking cessation 
counseling (if necessary) and palliative care should also be integrated 
into the disease management strategy. Data suggest that early palliative 
care is associated with higher quality of life in patients with metastatic 
NSCLC.720  
Molecular testing for somatic, disease-associated oncogenic driver 
mutations or alterations should be conducted as part of broad molecular 
profiling, which is strongly recommended by the panel. Broad molecular 
profiling is defined as molecular testing that identifies all actionable 
molecular biomarkers specified in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC in 
either a single assay or a combination of a limited number of assays, and 
optimally also identifies emerging biomarkers. Tiered approaches based 
on low prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable. The goal 
of broad molecular profiling is to identify driver alterations that can guide 
use of available targeted therapies or to appropriately counsel patients 
regarding potential clinical trials that may be available. Therefore, broad 
molecular profiling is considered a key component of improving care for 
patients with NSCLC. 
Molecular testing via biopsy and/or plasma testing is recommended; 
combinations of tissue and plasma testing, either concurrently or in 
sequence, are acceptable. Evidence suggests that concurrent testing 
can improve time to test results and should be considered depending on 
the clinical situation.197,1012-1017 Negative results (defined as the absence 
of a definitive driver mutation) by one method suggest that a 
complementary method may be used.  
Molecular testing for EGFR, ALK, KRAS, ROS1, BRAF, NTRK1/2/3, 
METex14 skipping, RET, and ERBB2 (HER2) alterations is 
recommended in all patients with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous 
NSCLC (ie, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma) and NSCLC not 
otherwise specified (NOS); EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement 
testing are category 1 recommendations for patients with nonsquamous 
NSCLC or NSCLC NOS based on the data available to recommend 
targeted therapies for these biomarkers. As the cumulative incidence of 
targetable molecular alterations in squamous cell carcinoma across all 
alterations ranges from 2% to 10%,136,137,184,185 the same molecular 
testing should be considered in all patients with advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma, and not just those with certain clinical 
characteristics, such as never smoking status and mixed histology.  
If a clinically actionable biomarker is found, the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC provide appropriate therapy recommendations. If results are 
unknown or pending, patients can be treated as if they do not have driver 
oncogenes. However, retrospective data indicate that the availability of 
molecular testing prior to treatment initiation is associated with longer 
overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced nonsquamous 
NSCLC.1018 If patients require an urgent start to therapy, clinicians 
should consider holding immunotherapy for one cycle (ie, just use 
platinum-based chemotherapy regimens). Clinicians need to be aware of 
the long half-life of immune checkpoint inhibitors and the potential for 
higher rates of side effects when using certain targeted therapies, (such 
as osimertinib) in combination with or following checkpoint 
inhibitors.828,829,1019,1020  
If a clinical actionable biomarker is discovered during first-line systemic 
therapy, then the planned systemic therapy (including maintenance 
therapy) can be either interrupted or completed before switching to the 
appropriate targeted therapy. Factors that can be considered to guide
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 201 ===
this decision include the level of toxicity that the patient is experiencing 
and whether a clinical or radiographic response has been observed.  
Upfront programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression testing before 
first-line therapy is also a category 1 recommendation (regardless of 
histology) in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC to assess how 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) could be used if no actionable 
molecular biomarkers are identified. Treatment options for advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC without actionable molecular biomarkers are stratified 
by PD-L1 level and include systemic therapy options such as 
immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy (see NSCL-37 and NSCL-
38 in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Refer to the full Guidelines at 
www.NCCN.org for complete treatment recommendations for advanced 
or metastatic NSCLC based on PD-L1 levels in the absence of a 
clinically actionable marker. 
In the NCCN Guidelines, targeted therapies with a first-line indication are 
recommended as initial therapy (rather than first-line ICIs) for patients 
with advanced or metastatic NSCLC and some (but not all) oncogenic 
drivers, regardless of PD-L1 levels. The rationale is that targeted 
therapies typically yield higher response rates (eg, osimertinib, 80%) 
than ICIs (poor response rates) in the first-line setting, and targeted 
therapy is better tolerated.184,371,372,827,1021 It should be noted that targeted 
therapies are not available or recommended for NSCLC with certain 
actionable biomarkers in the first-line setting. For instance, patients with 
NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutations are likely to benefit from 
immunotherapy (with or without chemotherapy) in the first-line 
setting.184,1022,1023 Targeted therapies are recommended only in the 
second-line setting or later for those with KRAS G12C mutations.  
Monitoring is recommended during initial therapy with response 
assessment with CT (with or without contrast) of known or high-risk sites 
of diasease (such as chest, abdomen, and pelvis) after 2 cycles and then every 2 to 4 cycles. Likewise, monitoring of known or high-risk sites of 
disease is also recommended during maintenance or subsequent 
therapy with CT (with or without contrast) every 6 to 12 weeks.  
For complete treatment recommendations for advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC, see NSCL-19. 
NSCLC with EGFR Alterations 
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase 
that is altered in a subset of patients with NSCLC. The two most 
common EGFR alterations in NSCLC are deletions in exon 19 (with 
conserved deletion of the LREA sequence) and a point mutation in exon 
21 (L858R); these represent approximately 85% to 90% of all EGFR 
alterations in NSCLC.246 Both result in activation of the tyrosine kinase 
domain and are associated with sensitivity to small-molecule EGFR 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).244 These EGFR alterations are found in 
approximately 10% of white patients with NSCLC and up to 19% of Black 
and 50% of Asian patients.245,1024,1025  
Other less common EGFR mutations (approximately 10%) include exon 
20 S768I, exon 21 L861Q, and/or exon 18 G719X.246,247 These mutations 
have varying degrees of sensitivity to first- (erlotinib/gefitinib), 
second- (afatinib/dacomitinib), and third- (osimertinib) generation EGFR 
TKIs.246,247,291-293,1026  
EGFR T790M is an EGFR exon 20 mutation associated with acquired 
resistance to EGFR TKI therapy and has been reported in about 60% of 
patients with disease progression after initial response to afatinib, 
erlotinib, or gefitinib.210,265-271 If EGFR T790M is identified in the absence 
of prior EGFR TKI therapy, genetic counseling and possible germline 
genetic testing are warranted. Identification of germline EGFR T790M 
confers a high risk for lung cancer regardless of smoking status.

EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are the third most common group of 
EGFR mutations; they occur in approximately 2% of patients with 
NSCLC and 4% to 12% of patients with EGFR mutations.179,259,294,295 
EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are a heterogeneous group; while 
NSCLC with these variants generally have low response rates to early-
generation EGFR TKIs, variable levels of response with newer therapies 
have been reported, depending on the variant.178,179,257,1027  
Clinical Data: NSCLC with EGFR Exon 19 Deletion or Exon 21 L858R 
Mutations 
Osimertinib is a third-generation oral EGFR TKI that is approved by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of NSCLC 
with EGFR alterations.1028,1029 Osimertinib monotherapy and osimertinib 
in combination with platinum and pemetrexed chemotherapy are both 
indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic NSCLC with 
EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation.  
FLAURA, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed first-line therapy with 
osimertinib compared with either erlotinib or gefitinib in patients with 
metastatic NSCLC and EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or 
L858R).18,371,1030,1031 The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 
longer with osimertinib compared with either erlotinib or gefitinib (18.9 
months vs. 10.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; P < .001).371 The 
median duration of response was longer with osimertinib compared with 
erlotinib or gefitinib (median response, 17.2 vs. 8.5 months).371 Only 6% 
of patients receiving osimertinib had central nervous system (CNS) 
progression events when compared with 15% of those receiving erlotinib 
or gefitinib.371 Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were reported in 
34% of patients receiving osimertinib and 45% of those receiving 
erlotinib or gefitinib.371 An updated analysis showed that median overall 
survival (OS) was 38.6 months with osimertinib compared with 31.8 
months for either erlotinib or gefitinib (HR, 0.8; P = .046).18  
FLAURA2, a phase 3 open-label randomized study, evaluated first-line 
therapy with osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy (pemetrexed 
and either cisplatin or carboplatin) versus osimertinib monotherapy in 
557 patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion or 
L858R.1032 The histology was adenocarcinoma in 99% of the patient 
population. The median investigator assessed PFS was longer in 
patients who received osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy 
compared with those who received only osimertinib (25.5 vs. 16.7 
months; HR, 0.62; P < .001). The median duration of response was also 
longer with osimertinib plus chemotherapy compared with osimertinib 
alone (24.0 vs. 15.3 months). The number of grade 3 AEs was higher 
with osimertinib plus chemotherapy than with osimertinib monotherapy 
and was primarily driven by known chemotherapy-related AEs. 
Amivantamab-vmjw is a bispecific human antibody to EGFR and MET 
that has been studied in a variety of contexts of NSCLC with EGFR 
mutations.178 For patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR exon 19 
deletion or L858R mutation whose disease progressed on or after 
osimertinib monotherapy, MARIPOSA-2, a phase 3 randomized trial, 
evaluated the efficacy of amivantamab-vmjw in combination with 
chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed) as subsequent therapy 
compared with chemotherapy.1033 The median PFS was longer for the 
amivantamab-vmjw plus chemotherapy group than the chemotherapy 
group (6.3 months vs. 4.2 months; HR, 0.48; P < .001). The objective 
response rate was 64% with amivantamab-vmjw plus chemotherapy 
versus 36% with chemotherapy alone. No statistically significant 
difference in OS was reported in the interim analysis. The most common 
grade 3 or higher AEs were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and 
leukopenia. 
Multiple studies have shown that other single-agent EGFR inhibitors and 
combination regimens also have efficacy in patients with advanced or

metastatic NSCLC and EGFR alterations.181,250,256,1034-1036 Erlotinib, 
gefitinib, and dacomitinib have all been approved by the FDA for the 
treatment of metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 
deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations.1037-1039 Erlotinib in 
combination with either ramucirumab1040 or bevacizumab1036,1041 can also 
be considered as options.  
Several studies have reported that programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-
1)/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy in the second-line setting is less effective 
in EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R-positive NSCLC, regardless 
of PD-L1 expression.358,827,834,835 Recent data also suggest that PD-1 
inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in combination with chemotherapy as 
subsequent therapy may not have an OS or PFS benefit compared with 
chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic NSCLC and EGFR exon 
19 deletion or exon 21 L858R.1042 
NCCN Recommendations: Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC with EGFR 
Exon 19 Deletion or Exon 21 L858R Mutations (NSCL-21, NSCL-22, and 
NSCL-23) 
In the first-line setting, the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends single-
agent osimertinib as a preferred treatment option for patients with 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 
L858R mutations. Single-agent erlotinib, afatinib, gefitinib, or dacomitinib 
are other recommended first-line treatment options. All of these are 
category 1 recommendations and are appropriate for patients with 
performance status 0–4. 
The following combination regimens are also included in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC as “other recommended” options for advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R 
mutations in the first-line setting: osimertinib in combination with 
pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin (category 1; 
nonsquamous), erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab 
(nonsquamous and no recent history of hemoptysis), or erlotinib in 
combination with ramucirumab. An FDA-approved biosimilar is an 
appropriate substitute for bevacizumab.  
Targeted therapies are also recommended as an option if an EGFR exon 
19 deletion or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation is discovered during 
first-line systemic therapy. For patients receiving first-line ICIs with or 
without chemotherapy, oncologists should be aware of the long half-life 
of the ICI and potential AEs when using osimertinib (or other TKIs) in 
combination with or following ICIs.828,829,1019,1020 For example, the rate of 
AEs, such as pneumonitis, is higher when osimertinib is initiated within 3 
months of treatment with certain ICIs.828 
In patients who experience disease progression after receiving first-line 
osimertinib, decisions about subsequent therapies are guided by disease 
symptoms as well as sites of progression. Changes in systemic therapy 
are generally recommended if patients have symptomatic systemic 
progression and/or multiple lesions. When considering second-line 
systemic therapy, ideally patients should be re-biopsied to rule out 
transformation to small cell histology, a phenomenon that occurs in 
approximately 5% EGFR TKI-resistant tumors.265,278 Amivantamab-vmjw 
in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed is a category 1 and 
preferred treatment option for patients with multiple lesions (if 
nonsquamous). Systemic therapy options such as chemotherapy (NSCL-
K 1 of 5 or NSCL-K 2 of 5 in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC) are also 
recommended for patients with symptomatic systemic progression. Data 
in the second-line setting suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy 
is less effective in EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R NSCLC, 
irrespective of PD-L1 expression.358,827,834,835  
Definitive local therapy has a role in the treatment of metastatic EGFR-
positive NSCLC. For patients with a limited number of initial sites of 
metastasis (oligometastasis; limited number is not universally defined,
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 204 ===
but clinical trials have included 3-5 metastases), definitive local therapy 
(eg, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy [SABR] or surgery) should be 
considered as consolidation after initiating EGFR TKI therapy (local 
consolidative therapy) if not given prior to EGFR TKI therapy (see 
Principles of Radiation Therapy [NSCL-C] and NSCL-15 in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Local therapy may also be an appropriate 
subsequent therapy option for certain patients who have progressed 
after initial therapy with an EGFR TKI. For those with asymptomatic 
progression or symptomatic systemic progression that is limited in nature 
(oligoprogression), definitive local therapy (eg, SABR or surgery) should 
be considered for limited lesions regardless of prior TKI therapy; image-
guided thermal ablation (IGTA) therapy may also be an option (see 
Principles of Image-Guided Thermal Ablation Therapy [NSCL-D] in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). For those with CNS progression, definitive 
local therapy (eg, stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] with or without surgical 
resection) should be considered for symptomatic lesions, and SRS 
should be considered for asymptomatic lesions at risk of symptomatic 
progression based on factors including size, location, and edema. See 
also the NCCN Guidelines for CNS Cancers on www.NCCN.org for 
additional recommendations. 
If the patient experiences disease progression after treatment with 
osimertinib as well as chemotherapy with pemetrexed and either cisplatin 
or carboplatin then the subsequent therapy options listed on NSCL-K 4 
of 5 in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC (such as chemotherapy) can be 
considered.  
Clinical Data: NSCLC with EGFR S768I, L861Q, and/or G719X Mutations  
For patients with the less common EGFR S768I, L861Q, and/or G719X 
mutations, treatment recommendations are based on non-randomized 
studies. Afatinib is a second-generation oral TKI that irreversibly inhibits 
the ErbB/HER family of receptors including EGFR and HER2.1043,1044 
Afatinib is approved by the FDA for the first-line treatment of metastatic 
NSCLC whose tumors have some EFGR mutations.1045 A post-hoc 
analysis of several LUX-Lung trials (LUX-Lung 2, 3, and 6) assessed 
afatinib in patients with advanced NSCLC and the most frequent 
uncommon EGFR mutations (L861Q, G719X, and S768I).1026 Median OS 
was 19.4 months. A response to afatinib was reported in 8 patients 
(100%) with EGFR S768I mutations. Among those with EGFR G719X 
mutations, an objective response to afatinib was reported in 14 patients 
(77.8%), while a response to afatinib was reported in 9 patients (56.3%) 
of those with EGFR L861Q.  
Osimertinib has also been studied in patients with less common EGFR 
mutations, including S768I, L861Q, and G719X. KCSG-LU15-09, a 
phase 2 trial based in Korea, assessed first-line therapy with osimertinib 
in patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC and these mutations.291 
The median PFS was 8.2 months and the objective response rate was 
50%. An objective response with osimertinib was observed in 78% (7/9) 
of those with EGFR L861Q, 53% (10/19) of those with EGFR G719X, 
and 38% (3/8) of those with EGFR S768I). The median PFS was 15.2 
months, 8.2 months, and 12.3 months in the L861Q, G719X and S768I 
groups, respectively. Manageable AEs included rash, pruritus, 
decreased appetite, diarrhea, and dyspnea.291  
Retrospective data suggest that the clinical response to osimertinib 
versus afatinib may differ, depending on the exact EGFR mutation 
identified; for example, NSCLC with EGFR L861Q may be more likely to 
respond to osimertinib than afatinib.1026,1046,1047  
NCCN Recommendations: Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC with EGFR 
S768I, L861Q, and/or G719X Mutations (NSCL-24) 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends afatinib or osimertinib as 
preferred first-line therapy options for patients with advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC with the less common EGFR S768I, L861Q, and/or

G719X mutations. All are appropriate for patients with performance 
status 0–4.  
Subsequent treatment options for advanced or metastatic NSCLC with 
EGFR S768I, L861Q, and/or G719X alterations that progressed following 
first-line treatment with afatinib, osimertinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, or 
dacomitinib are the same as for the more common EGFR alterations – 
refer to NSCL-22 and NSCL-23 and the subsequent therapy treatment 
recommendations for advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 
19 deletion or exon 21 L858R detailed above. 
Clinical Data: NSCLC with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutation 
For patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 20 insertions, treatment with 
early-generation EGFR TKIs has generally not been associated with 
disease response.178,179,257 Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion-positive 
metastatic NSCLC have frequently been treated with first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy.297,299 The response rates (0%–25%) to 
immunotherapy regimens vary, depending on the specific EGFR exon 20 
insertion mutation.179,302 Mobocertinib, an EGFR TKI developed 
specifically for patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions, was previously 
granted accelerated approval by the FDA in the United States. However, 
mobocertinib was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2023 and is no 
longer recommended as a subsequent treatment option by the panel 
based on data from the phase 3 EXCLAIM-2 trial, which compared first-
line mobocertinib to platinum-based chemotherapy, as the primary 
endpoint was not met.1048,1049 
Single-agent amivantamab-vmjw is FDA-approved for the treatment of 
adults with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 
insertion mutations, whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-
based chemotherapy.1050 CHRYSALIS, a phase 1 study, assessed 
subsequent therapy with amivantamab-vmjw in 81 patients with EGFR 
exon 20 insertion positive metastatic NSCLC who had received one or
more previous lines of therapy.178 The overall response rate was 40%, 
with 3 complete responses. The median PFS was 8.3 months. Common 
treatment-related AEs included cutaneous reactions, infusion-related 
reactions, and paronychia. The most common grade 3 to 4 AEs included 
hypokalemia as well as pulmonary embolism, neutropenia, diarrhea, and 
rash. Eight deaths were reported in the safety assessment (7%).  
Amivantamab-vmjw in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed is 
also approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion 
mutations.1050 PAPILLON, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed the 
efficacy and safety of first-line amivantamab-vmjw plus chemotherapy 
(pemetrexed and carboplatin) versus chemotherapy alone in 308 
patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions who had 
not previously received systemic therapy.1051 The median PFS was 
longer in the amivantamab-vmjw plus chemotherapy group than in the 
chemotherapy alone group (11.4 months vs. 6.7 months; HR, 0.40; P < 
.001). Based on the interim OS analysis, the HR for amivantamab-vmjw 
plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone was 0.67 (P = .11). The 
most common AEs reported with amivantamab-vmjw plus chemotherapy 
were hematologic effects and skin-related EGFR-related toxic events 
(eg, rash, paronychia, dermatitis acneiform).  
NCCN Recommendations: Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC with EGFR 
Exon 20 Insertion Mutation (NSCL-25) 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends amivantamab-vmjw in 
combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed as a category 1 and 
preferred treatment option for patients with advanced or metastatic 
nonsquamous EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation-positive NSCLC. Other 
systemic therapy regimens (eg, chemotherapy) listed on NSCL-K 1 of 5 
or NSCL-K 2 of 5 in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC are also 
recommended as first-line treatment options. Data indicate that ICI

monotherapy is associated with low activity in NSCLC with EGFR 
alterations.184,1052 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends amivantamab-vmjw as a 
subsequent therapy option for patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion 
mutation-positive advanced or metastatic NSCLC and disease 
progression who were not previously treated with amivantamab-vmjw. 
For patients whose disease progressed after first-line treatment with 
amivantamab-vmjw in combination with chemotherapy, subsequent 
therapy options listed on NSCL-K 4 of 5 in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC are recommended.  
NSCLC with KRAS G12C Mutation 
KRAS is a protein with intrinsic GTPase activity that is commonly 
mutated in lung cancers; these mutations can result in unregulated 
signaling through the MAP/ERK pathway.1053,1054 KRAS G12C is an 
activating mutation that results in increased activation of downstream 
oncogenic pathways.317 Data suggest that approximately 25% of patients 
with adenocarcinomas in a North American population have a KRAS 
mutation, the most common mutation in this population.118,175,211,307,308 
Some, but not all, KRAS mutations are associated with cigarette 
smoking, unlike many of the other actionable mutations (eg, EGFR 
mutations, ALK rearrangements).309,1055  
Clinical Data 
Targeted therapies are not recommended as first-line treatment options 
for advanced or metastatic NSCLC with a KRAS G12C mutation, unlike 
most other actionable alterations. Data indicate that patients with 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC and KRAS mutations are likely to derive 
benefit from immunotherapy-based regimens in the first-line 
setting.1022,1023 Additionally, one study reported a positive association 
between PFS and PD-L1 expression in patients with advanced NSCLC 
and KRAS mutations who received ICI monotherapy.184 
Two targeted therapies are available as subsequent therapy options for 
NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutations. Adagrasib and sotorasib are oral 
small molecules that target KRAS G12C and have both been granted 
accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of adults with KRAS 
G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who received at 
least one prior systemic therapy.315,1056,1057  
A phase 2 study assessed sotorasib as subsequent therapy in 126 
patients with KRAS G12C mutation-positive advanced NSCLC who had 
previously received platinum-based chemotherapy (± PD-1 or PD-L1 
immunotherapy).317 The median OS was 12.5 months and the objective 
response rate was 37.1%; a complete response was reported in 4 
patients. Treatment-related grade 3 AEs occurred in 19.8% of patients, 
including diarrhea, and increased alanine transaminase (ALT) and 
aspartate transferase (AST) levels; one treatment-related grade 4 event 
occurred (dyspnea and pneumonitis).  
A phase 2 study evaluated adagrasib as subsequent therapy in 116 
patients with KRAS G12C mutation-positive advanced NSCLC who had 
previously received at least one platinum-based chemotherapy and 
immunotherapy.315 The median OS was 12.6 months and the objective 
response rate was 42.9%. The intracranial response rate was 33.3%. 
Grade 3 or higher AEs occurred in 44.8% of patients, including anemia, 
pneumonia, dyspnea, acute kidney injury, hyponatremia, fatigue, 
nausea, and increased ALT and AST levels. There were two deaths 
(cardiac failure and pulmonary hemorrhage). 
A randomized phase 3 trial compared subsequent therapy with sotorasib 
to treatment with docetaxel in 345 patients with KRAS G12C 
mutation-positive advanced NSCLC who had previously received
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 207 ===
platinum-based chemotherapy plus a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.316 Median 
PFS was 5.6 months in patients receiving sotorasib compared with 4.5 
months in those receiving docetaxel (HR, 0.66; P = .0017). There was no 
reported difference in OS. 
NCCN Recommendations (NSCL-26) 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends using PD-L1 level to determine 
the appropriate first-line systemic therapy regimen (such as 
immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy) for patients with advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutations. See NSCL-37 and 
NSCL-38 in the full NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC at www.NCCN.org for 
treatment recommendations based on PD-L1 level.  
The panel recommends sotorasib or adagrasib as subsequent therapy 
options for patients who experience disease progression after treatment 
with first-line systemic therapy. Sotorasib or adagrasib may also be used 
as third-line therapy or beyond if the patient has not previously received 
a KRAS G12C-targeted therapy. The panel notes that switching between 
agents with a similar mechanism of action at the time of progression is 
not recommended.  
NSCLC with ALK Rearrangement 
About 5% of patients with NSCLC have ALK gene rearrangements 
leading to gene fusions.120 These events can result in dysregulation and 
inappropriate ALK signaling.1058  
Clinical Data 
Initial studies have shown that single-agent ALK inhibitors (crizotinib and 
ceritinib) are superior to chemotherapy in patients with advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC with ALK rearrangements.218-220,1059 Both crizotinib 
and ceritinib are FDA-approved for the treatment of adults with ALK-
positive metastatic NSCLC.1060,1061 Subsequent trials have compared 
newer agents to crizotinib
Alectinib is an ALK inhibitor that is approved by the FDA for the 
treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC.1062,1063 ALEX, 
a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed first-line therapy with alectinib 
versus crizotinib in 303 patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC 
including those with asymptomatic CNS disease.218 Disease progression 
or death occurred in a lower proportion of patients receiving alectinib 
when compared with crizotinib (41% vs. 68%). Investigator-assessed 
PFS rate was higher with alectinib versus crizotinib (68.4% versus 
48.7%; HR, 0.47; P < .001). The median PFS was not reached for 
alectinib when compared with crizotinib at 11.1 months. Fewer patients 
receiving alectinib had CNS progression (12%) versus crizotinib (45%). 
Response rates were 82.9% in the alectinib group versus 75.5% in the 
crizotinib group (P = .09). Patients receiving alectinib had fewer grade 3 
or higher AEs than those who received crizotinib (41% vs. 50%, 
respectively) even though patients received alectinib for a longer 
duration than crizotinib (median, 17.9 vs. 10.7 months). Fewer deaths 
were reported with alectinib (3.3%) versus crizotinib (4.6%); two 
treatment-related deaths were reported with crizotinib and none with 
alectinib. An updated analysis of the trial reported that the five-year OS 
rate was 62.5% with alectinib and 45.5% with crizotinib.14 
J-ALEX, a phase 3 open-label randomized trial, assessed first-line 
therapy with alectinib versus crizotinib in 207 Japanese patients with 
ALK-positive advanced NSCLC who were ALK inhibitor-naive.1064 Median 
PFS was not reached with alectinib versus 10.2 months with crizotinib 
(HR, 0.34; stratified log-rank P < .0001). Grade 3 or 4 AEs were less 
frequent with alectinib (26%) than with crizotinib (52%). Fewer patients 
stopped taking alectinib (9%) because of an AE when compared with 
crizotinib (20%).  
Brigatinib is an ALK inhibitor that is approved by the FDA for the 
treatment of adults with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC.1065,1066
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 208 ===
ALTA-1L, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed brigatinib versus 
crizotinib as first-line therapy in 275 patients with ALK-positive metastatic 
NSCLC.221 At the first interim analysis, PFS rate was higher in patients 
receiving brigatinib (67%) than in those receiving crizotinib (43%) (HR, 
0.49; P < .001). The rate of intracranial response was also higher with 
brigatinib (78%) versus crizotinib (29%).221 At the second interim analysis 
(24.9 months of median follow-up), brigatinib continued to show 
improved blinded independent review committee (BIRC)-assessed PFS 
when compared with crizotinib (48% vs. 26%; HR, 0.49; P 
<.0001).1067 After 3 years, the PFS was 43% for brigatinib versus 19% for 
crizotinib (HR, 0.48). The median OS was not reached in either arm; 
however, a post-hoc analysis suggested a survival benefit for patients 
with intracranial metastasis (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.89).1068 
Lorlatinib is an ALK inhibitor that is approved by the FDA for the 
treatment of adults with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC.1069 CROWN, a 
phase 3 randomized trial, assessed lorlatinib versus crizotinib as first-line 
therapy in 296 patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.217 At 12 
months, 78% of patients were alive without disease progression in the 
lorlatinib group versus 39% in the crizotinib group (HR, 0.28; P < .001). 
The objective response rate was 76% for patients receiving lorlatinib and 
58% for those receiving crizotinib. For patients with measurable brain 
metastases, an intracranial response was reported in 82% of those 
receiving lorlatinib and 23% of those receiving crizotinib. A complete 
intracranial response was achieved in 71% of those who received 
lorlatinib. Hyperlipidemia, edema, increased weight, peripheral 
neuropathy, and cognitive effects were the most common AEs seen with 
lorlatinib. More grade 3 or 4 AEs (mainly altered lipid levels) occurred 
with lorlatinib than with crizotinib (72% vs. 56%, respectively). A post hoc 
analysis of the CROWN study showed that in patients with brain 
metastases at baseline, the 12-month cumulative incidence of CNS 
progression was 7% with lorlatinib compared with 72% with crizotinib; the
12-month PFS rates were 78% versus 22%, respectively.1070 In patients 
without brain metastases at baseline, the 12-month cumulative incidence 
of CNS progression was 1% with lorlatinib compared with 18% with 
crizotinib; the 12-month PFS rates were 78% versus 45%, 
respectively.1070 Updated data from the CROWN trial demonstrated that 
the 3-year PFS rate was 64% with lorlatinib and 19% with crizotinib.1071 
Additionally, the HR for time to intracranial progression for lorlatinib in 
comparison to crizotinib was 0.10 among those with baseline brain 
metastases and 0.02 among those without brain metastases at baseline. 
Data have suggested that lorlatinib can be used as subsequent therapy 
in patients with disease progression after treatment with other ALK 
inhibitors, including those with CNS metastases.1072,1073 A phase 2 trial 
assessed lorlatinib in patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive 
advanced NSCLC and disease progression after ALK inhibitor therapy; 
many patients had asymptomatic CNS metastases.1072 In the cohort of 
ALK-positive patients who had received at least one previous ALK 
inhibitor, objective responses were achieved in 47% of patients; there 
were 4 complete responses and 89 partial responses. In those with 
measurable baseline CNS lesions, an objective intracranial response 
was observed in 63% of patients. Lorlatinib was effective in patients who 
had received up to three previous ALK inhibitors. Grade 3 to 4 AEs 
included hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Serious 
treatment-related AEs occurred in 7% of patients including cognitive 
effects in 1%; the cognitive effects resulted in permanent discontinuation 
of lorlatinib.  
Data from this trial also showed that lorlatinib is effective as subsequent 
therapy in patients with the resistance mutation ALK G1202R, which is 
often detected after progression on second-generation ALK TKIs such as 
brigatinib, alectinib, or ceritinib.1074 The objective response rate with 
lorlatinib was 62% when using plasma ctDNA (and 69% when using
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 209 ===
tissue) for patients with ALK resistance mutations and disease 
progression on second-generation ALK TKIs compared with 32% 
(plasma) and 27% (tissue) in patients without ALK mutations. However, 
data from other studies suggest that lorlatinib may not be effective in 
NSCLC with resistant compound ALK mutations (eg, combination of 
L1196M and G1202R).1074-1076  
NCCN Recommendations (NSCL-27, NSCL-28, and NSCL-29) 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends alectinib, brigatinib, or lorlatinib 
as preferred first-line therapy options for patients with advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC and ALK rearrangements. Ceritinib is an “other 
recommended” first-line option, whereas crizotinib is considered useful in 
certain circumstances. All these options are appropriate for patients with 
performance status 0–4 and are category 1 recommendations if an ALK 
rearrangement is discovered prior to first-line systemic therapy.  
Upon disease progression, the NCCN Panel recommends considering 
plasma and/or tissue-based testing using broad molecular profiling to 
determine genomic resistance mechanisms and to guide use of 
subsequent therapy options.1074  
After progression on alectinib, brigatinib, or ceritinib, the NCCN Panel 
recommends a switch in treatment to lorlatinib. Continuing lorlatinib is an 
option for those who experienced disease progression on or after 
lorlatinib given in the first-line setting. Lorlatinib can be used for NSCLC 
with resistant mutations such as ALK G1202R or L1196M, but not if 
compound resistant mutations are detected (ie, both L1196M and 
G1202R). Continuing the same TKI that was used in the first-line setting 
is another option, except for those with symptomatic systemic 
progression and multiple lesions.  
Systemic therapy options such as chemotherapy (see NSCL-K 1 of 5 or 
NSCL-K 2 of 5 in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC) are recommended as 
additional subsequent therapy options for patients with symptomatic 
systemic progression and multiple lesions. Data suggest that PD-1/PD-
L1 inhibitor monotherapy is less effective in ALK-positive NSCLC, 
irrespective of PD-L1 expression.184,827,1052 
Definitive local therapy has a role in the treatment of metastatic ALK-
positive NSCLC. For patients with a limited number of initial sites of 
metastasis (oligometastasis; limited number is not universally defined, 
but clinical trials have included 3-5 metastases), definitive local therapy 
(eg, SABR or surgery) should be considered as consolidation after 
initiating ALK TKI therapy (local consolidative therapy) if not given prior 
to ALK TKI therapy (see Principles of Radiation Therapy [NSCL-C] and 
NSCL-15 in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Local therapy may also 
be an appropriate subsequent therapy option for certain patients who 
have progressed after initial therapy with an ALK TKI. For those with 
asymptomatic progression or symptomatic systemic progression that is 
limited in nature (oligoprogression), definitive local therapy (eg, SABR or 
surgery) should be considered for limited lesions; IGTA therapy (eg, 
cryotherapy, microwave ablation, radiofrequency ablation) may also be 
an option for certain patients (see Principles of Image-Guided Thermal 
Ablation Therapy [NSCL-D] in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). For 
patients with CNS progression, definitive local therapy (eg, SRS with or 
without surgical resection) should be considered for symptomatic lesions, 
and SRS should be considered for asymptomatic lesions at risk of 
symptomatic progression based on factors including size, location, and 
edema. See also the NCCN Guidelines for CNS Cancers on 
www.NCCN.org for additional recommendations. 
NSCLC with ROS1 Rearrangement 
It is estimated that ROS1 gene rearrangements occur in about 1% to 2% 
of patients with NSCLC.344-347 ROS1 rearrangements can result in ROS1 
kinase dysregulation and inappropriate signaling. Although ROS1 is a
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 210 ===
distinct receptor tyrosine kinase, it is similar to ALK and members of the 
insulin receptor family.343,344 Several (but not all) targeted therapies 
recommended for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC are 
also recommended for the treatment of ROS1-positive metastatic 
disease (ie, ceritinib, crizotinib, lorlatinib). 
Clinical Data 
Crizotinib is a first-generation oral TKI that inhibits ALK, ROS1, and 
MET.190,219,318,1078-1082 Crizotinib is approved for the treatment of adults 
with ROS1-positive and ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC.1060 Crizotinib is 
effective for patients with ROS1 rearrangements with response rates of 
about 70% to 80% including complete responses.190,344,349,1083,1084 A 
phase 2 single-arm trial assessed crizotinib in 127 East Asian patients 
with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC who had received 3 or fewer lines 
of systemic therapy. The objective response rate was 71.7% with 17 
complete responses; the median duration of response was 19.7 months. 
The median PFS was 15.9 months.1084  
PROFILE 1001, a phase 1 study, assessed crizotinib in 50 patients with 
advanced NSCLC and ROS1 rearrangements.344 Crizotinib yielded an 
objective response rate of 72%; there were 3 complete responses and 
33 partial responses.344 The median duration of response was 17.6 
months, and the median PFS was 19.2 months. Updated results from 
PROFILE 1001 reported an objective response rate of 72% with 
crizotinib including 6 confirmed complete responses in 53 patients with 
ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC.22 The median OS was 51.4 months. 
No grade 4 or higher treatment-related AEs were reported.  
The phase 2 single-arm EUCROSS study reported that crizotinib yielded 
an objective response rate of 70% and a median PFS of 20 months in 30 
patients with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC.1083 AEs related to 
treatment occurred in 97% of patients. A retrospective study based on 
data from Europe in patients (n = 30 evaluable) with stage IV lung
adenocarcinoma and ROS1 rearrangements also assessed crizotinib.190 
There were 5 complete responses (overall response rate, 80%; disease 
control rate, 86.7%). The median PFS was 9.1 months. Many patients (n 
= 26) received pemetrexed (either alone or in combination with platinum 
and either before or after crizotinib) and had a response rate of 57.7%; 
the median PFS was 7.2 months.  
Entrectinib is an oral TKI that inhibits several kinases (including ROS1, 
ALK, and TRK) and is approved by the FDA for the treatment of ROS1-
positive metastatic NSCLC.330,1085,1086 Entrectinib has been assessed in 
several phase 1 and 2 trials in patients with ROS1-positive metastatic 
NSCLC (ie, phase 2 STARTRK-2 trial, phase 1 STARTRK-1 trial, phase 
1 ALKA-372-001 trial).348,1087 Pooled data from these 3 trials in 53 
patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC receiving first-line 
entrectinib showed an objective response rate of 77% (3 complete 
responses).348,357 The intracranial overall response rate was 55% (4 
complete responses, 7 partial responses) among the 20 patients with 
baseline CNS metastases.348,1087 In the larger ROS1 population (n = 
134), grade 3 to 4 AEs were seen in 34% of patients. Fifteen patients 
had serious AEs such as nervous system disorders and cardiac 
disorders. Although entrectinib has better CNS penetration than 
crizotinib, it is more toxic.357  
Repotrectinib is a next-generation ROS1, TRK, and ALK TKI that is 
approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or 
metastatic ROS1-positive NSCLC.1088,1089 The phase 1 and 2 TRIDENT-1 
trial evaluated repotrectinib in 71 patients with ROS1 fusion-positive 
NSCLC who had not previously received a ROS1 TKI and 56 patients 
with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC who had previously received one 
ROS1 TKI (crizotinib, entrectinib, or ceritinib) and never received 
chemotherapy.1090 The confirmed objective response with repotrectinib 
was 79% among those who had not received a ROS1 TKI and 38%
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 211 ===
among those who had received one ROS1 TKI. Patients who had not 
received a ROS1 TKI had a median duration of response of 34.1 months 
and median PFS of 35.7 months. Patients who previously received one 
ROS1 TKI and no chemotherapy had a median duration of response of 
14.8 months and a median PFS of 9 months. For those with measurable 
brain metastases at baseline, the intracranial objective response with 
repotrectinib was 89% (8/9) among those who had no previous ROS1 
TKI and 38% (5/13) among those who had one previous TKI and no 
chemotherapy. The most common treatment-related AEs were dizziness, 
dysgeusia, and paresthesia.  
Lorlatinib is an oral TKI that is active against both ALK and ROS1 and 
can penetrate the blood-brain barrier.1069,1091 A phase 1 to 2 trial 
assessed lorlatinib in 69 patients with ROS1-positive metastatic 
NSCLC.356 Many patients (58%) had previously received crizotinib; some 
patients were TKI naïve (30%). Objective responses were achieved in 
35% (14/40) of patients who previously received crizotinib and 62% 
(13/21) of those who were TKI-naïve. An intracranial response was 
observed in 50% (12/24) of patients who previously received crizotinib 
and 64% (7/11) of those who were TKI-naïve. Serious treatment-related 
AEs occurred in 7% of patients.  
Data suggest that ceritinib, an oral TKI that has activity against both ALK 
and ROS1, can also be considered as a treatment option for patients 
with NSCLC and ROS1 rearrangements.1061,1091,1092  
NCCN Recommendations (NSCL-30 and NSCL-31) 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends entrectinib, crizotinib, or 
repotrectinib as preferred first-line treatment options for patients with 
ROS1-positive advanced or metastatic NSCLC, while ceritinib is 
considered an “other recommended” first-line treatment option. All are 
appropriate for patients with performance status 0–4; however, 
entrectinib or repotrectinib may be better for patients with brain 
metastases. 
Upon disease progression, plasma or tissue-based testing via broad 
molecular profiling should be considered to identify genomic resistance 
mechanisms. If plasma-based testing is negative, the panel strongly 
recommends tissue-based testing with rebiopsy material.  
For asymptomatic progression on entrectinib, crizotinib, repotrectinib, or 
ceritinib, the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends repotrectinib (if not 
previously given) or lorlatinib as subsequent therapy options. For 
patients with CNS progression, entrectinib (if previously treated with 
crizotinib or ceritinib), repotrectinib (if previously treated with crizotinib, 
ceritinib, or entrectinib), or lorlatinib are recommended options. See also 
the NCCN Guidelines for CNS Cancers on www.NCCN.org for additional 
recommendations. For symptomatic systemic progression with multiple 
systemic lesions, repotrectinib (if not previously given) or lorlatinib are 
recommended targeted therapy options. Systemic therapies (such as 
chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy) can be considered in this 
setting as well (see NSCL-K 1 of 5 and NSCL-K 2 of 5 in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Data indicate that ICI monotherapy is less 
effective in NSCLC with ROS1 alterations.184,1052  
Continuation of entrectinib, crizotinib, repotrectinib, or ceritinib is also an 
option for certain patients with disease progression; continuation of these 
therapies is not recommended for those with symptomatic systemic 
progression and either multiple lesions or brain metastases. 
Definitive local therapy has a role in the treatment of metastatic ROS1-
positive NSCLC. For patients with a limited number of initial sites of 
metastasis (oligometastasis; limited number is not universally defined, 
but clinical trials have included 3-5 metastases), definitive local therapy 
(eg, SABR or surgery) should be considered as consolidation after

initiating ROS1 TKI therapy (local consolidative therapy) if not given prior 
to ROS1 TKI therapy (see Principles of Radiation Therapy [NSCL-C] and 
NSCL-15 in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Local therapy may also 
be an appropriate subsequent therapy option for certain patients who 
have progressed after initial therapy with a ROS1 TKI. For patients with 
asymptomatic or symptomatic systemic progression that is limited in 
nature (oligoprogression), definitive local therapy (eg, SABR or surgery) 
should be considered. IGTA therapy, such as cryotherapy, microwave 
ablation, or radiofrequency ablation, may also be an option for select 
patients; see Principles of Image-Guided Thermal Ablation Therapy 
(NSCL-D) in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC for additional information. 
For those with CNS progression, definitive local therapy (eg, SRS with or 
without surgical resection) should be considered for symptomatic lesions, 
and SRS should be considered for asymptomatic lesions at risk of 
symptomatic progression based on factors including size, location, and 
edema. See also the NCCN Guidelines for CNS Cancers on 
www.NCCN.org for additional recommendations. 
NSCLC with BRAF V600E Mutation 
The BRAF V600E mutation occurs in 1% to 2% of patients with lung 
adenocarcinoma; it is the most common of the BRAF point mutations 
when considered across all tumor types.188,241 Rare BRAF mutations 
include V600K and V600D. The BRAF gene encodes for BRAF, a 
serine/threonine kinase; activating mutations in BRAF result in 
unregulated signaling through the MAP/ERK pathway.1093  
Clinical Data 
Dabrafenib and encorafenib are both oral BRAF kinase 
inhibitors.188,189,1094,1095 Dabrafenib, in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitor 
trametinib, is approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic 
NSCLC with BRAF V600E mutation.1096 Encorafenib, in combination with 
MEK1/2 inhibitor binimetinib, is FDA-approved for the treatment of 
metastatic NSCLC with a BRAF V600E mutation.1097  
A phase 2 trial assessed dabrafenib in combination with trametinib as 
first-line therapy in 36 patients with metastatic NSCLC and BRAF V600E 
mutations.15,1098 The overall response rate was 63.9%; there were 2 
complete responses.15 The median PFS was 10.8 months.15 Many 
patients (69%) had one or more grade 3 or 4 AEs.1098 Serious AEs 
included increased ALT, increased AST, pyrexia, and decreased ejection 
fraction.1098 An updated analysis reported that patients receiving 
dabrafenib plus trametinib had a median OS of 17.3 months.15 After 5 
years, the OS rate was 22%. 
The same trial also assessed the dabrafenib plus trametinib regimen as 
subsequent therapy in 57 patients with advanced NSCLC and BRAF 
V600E mutations and disease progression on chemotherapy.15,188 The 
overall response rate was 68.4% and the median PFS was 10.2 
months.15 Serious AEs occurred in 56% of patients, including pyrexia, 
anemia, confused state, hemoptysis, hypercalcemia, and cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma.188 Grade 3 to 4 AEs included neutropenia, 
hyponatremia, and anemia.188 An updated analysis reported that the 
median OS was 18.2 months.15 After 5 years, the OS rate was 19%. 
A phase 2, open-label, single-arm study evaluated encorafenib in 
combination with binimetinib in patients with BRAF V600E-positive 
metastatic NSCLC in both the first-line and subsequent therapy 
settings.1095 The objective response rate was 75% in treatment-naïve 
patients and 46% in previously treated patients. The median PFS was 
not estimable for the treatment-naïve patients and 9.3 months in those 
who were previously treated. The most common treatment-related AEs 
were nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. One Grade 5 treatment-related AE 
(intracranial hemorrhage) was reported.

Data suggest that treatment with a single-agent BRAF inhibitor, such as 
vemurafenib, can also be used to treat patients with metastatic NSCLC 
and BRAF V600E.243 Results from retrospective studies indicate that 
patients with advanced NSCLC and BRAF mutations may also derive 
benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.184,1099 Therefore, first-line treatment 
with an ICI-based regimen can be considered, particularly for those with 
a minimal burden of disease and/or high PD-L1 levels. 
NCCN Recommendations (NSCL-32) 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends dabrafenib plus trametinib or 
encorafenib plus binimetinib as preferred first-line therapy options for 
patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC. The panel also recommends dabrafenib plus trametinib or 
encorafenib plus binimetinib as subsequent therapy options if the patient 
with BRAF V600E mutation did not previously receive a BRAF inhibitor. 
Single-agent therapy with dabrafenib or vemurafenib can be considered 
for those who do not tolerate dabrafenib plus trametinib. These options 
are all appropriate for patients with performance status 0–4.  
Other first-line therapy options include systemic therapy regimens (such 
as chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy) listed on NSCL-K 1 of 
5 and NSCL-K 2 of 5 in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC; these are 
designated as “other recommended” options. These regimens can also 
be used as subsequent therapy options for patients whose disease 
progressed after receiving a first-line therapy that included a BRAF 
inhibitor. 
NSCLC with NTRK Gene Fusion 
NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions encode TRK fusion proteins that act as 
oncogenic drivers for various solid tumors, including lung, salivary gland, 
thyroid, and sarcoma.328,1100 It is estimated that NTRK1/2/3 fusions occur 
in 0.2% of patients with NSCLC and do not typically overlap with other 
oncogenic drivers such as EGFR, ALK, or ROS1.327  
Clinical Data 
Entrectinib and larotrectinib are oral TRK inhibitors and both were 
granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of patients 
with solid tumors that have an NTRK gene fusion.1086,1100,1101 Entrectinib 
is also approved for the treatment of ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC 
(see above for more information).1086  
Entrectinib has been assessed in several phase 1 and 2 trials in patients 
with NTRK gene fusion-positive metastatic NSCLC (phase 2 
STARTRK-2 trial, phase 1 STARTRK-1 trial, and phase 1 ALKA-372-001 
trial).331 Pooled data from these 3 trials in 10 patients with NTRK gene 
fusion-positive NSCLC showed that entrectinib yielded an overall 
response rate of 70% (7/10).331 Updated data in 22 patients with NTRK-
positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC found that the objective 
response rate was 64.5%; a complete response was observed in 16.1% 
of patients.1102 Among the 15 patients with CNS metastases at baseline, 
the intracranial objective response rate was 60%. Most treatment-related 
AEs were grade 1 or 2.  
A study in 55 patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive disease across a 
range of solid tumors showed that larotrectinib yielded an overall 
response rate (by independent review) of 75%.328 In an analysis of 15 
patients with NTRK fusion-positive lung cancer, the objective response 
rate by investigator assessment was 73%; 1 patient had a complete 
response and 10 had a partial response.1103 The median OS was 40.7 
months, and the median PFS was 35.4 months. Among those with CNS 
metastases at baseline, the objective response rate was 63%. Most of 
the reported AEs were grade 1 or 2.

NCCN Recommendations (NSCL-33) 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends larotrectinib or entrectinib as 
preferred first-line therapy options for patients with NTRK1/2/3 gene 
fusion-positive advanced or metastatic NSCLC (performance status 0–4). 
Either may be used as a subsequent therapy option for NTRK1/2/3 gene 
fusion-positive metastatic NSCLC if larotrectinib or entrectinib was not 
previously given as first-line therapy.  
Other systemic therapies (such as chemotherapy with or without 
immunotherapy) on NSCL-K 1 of 5 and NSCL-K 2 of 5 in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC are categorized as first-line treatment options that 
may be useful in certain circumstances for NTRK-positive advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC; these are also recommended as subsequent therapy 
options for patients whose disease progressed after treatment with 
larotrectinib or entrectinib. Data indicate that ICI monotherapy may be 
less effective in NSCLC with NTRK mutations.184,1052  
NSCLC with MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutation 
METex14 skipping mutations occur in 3% to 4% of patients with 
adenocarcinoma NSCLC and 1% to 2% of patients with other NSCLC 
histologies.319,320 METex14 skipping mutations lead to dysregulation of 
the MET receptor tyrosine kinase and inappropriate signaling. The 
presence of this type of mutation is associated with responsiveness to 
oral MET TKIs. The NCCN Guidelines recommend testing for METex14 
skipping mutations as part of broad molecular profiling, due to the 
availability of FDA-approved targeted therapies for this biomarker. 
In contrast, high-level MET amplification is designated as an emerging 
biomarker in the NCCN Guidelines because there is less evidence for 
using targeted agents for this biomarker. In addition, no therapies have 
been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC with 
MET amplification.  
Clinical Data 
Capmatinib and tepotinib are oral TKIs that selectively inhibit MET kinase 
and are both approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with 
metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a MET exon 14 skipping 
mutation.1104-1106 
GEOMETRY, a phase 2 study, assessed capmatinib in different cohorts 
of patients with MET genomic alterations, including those with METex14 
skipping mutations; patients had stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and were 
wild-type for EGFR and ALK genomic alterations.170,324 Updated data 
from GEOMETRY showed that first-line therapy with capmatinib resulted 
in an overall response rate of 68% in 28 patients with METex14 skipping 
mutations; the median PFS was 12.4 months for first-line therapy.170 
Subsequent therapy with capmatinib yielded an overall response rate of 
41% in 69 patients with METex14 skipping mutations; the median PFS 
was 5.4 months for subsequent therapy.170 The data from GEOMETRY 
also suggest that capmatinib is effective for patients with brain 
metastases.170,1107 Among patients with brain metastases, a response to 
capmatinib was reported in 54%; 4 patients had a complete response in 
the brain. However, 43% of patients whose disease responded had 
previously received RT.170 Common AEs for patients with METex14 
skipping mutations across all cohorts included peripheral edema, 
nausea, and vomiting, but most of these events were grades 1 to 2.170 
One treatment-related death occurred.  
VISION, a phase 2 study, assessed tepotinib in patients with METex14 
skipping mutations; patients mainly had stage IV NSCLC and were 
wild-type (negative) for EGFR and ALK genomic alteration.167,1108,1109 The 
response rate to tepotinib was 46%; PFS was 8.5 months in the 
combined biopsy group (tissue biopsy plus plasma ctDNA).1109 Grade 3 
or higher AEs occurred in 28% of patients receiving tepotinib, such as 
peripheral edema; 11% of patients had to permanently discontinue

tepotinib because of peripheral edema, pleural effusion, or dyspnea.1109 
One treatment-related death occurred.1109 The 18-month follow-up 
analysis of VISION confirmed the efficacy of tepotinib in patients with 
METex14-positive advanced/metastatic NSCLC.1110 Among treatment-
naïve patients, the objective response rate with tepotinib was 57.3% and 
the median duration of response was 46.6 months. Among previously 
treated patients, the objective response rate was 45% and the median 
duration of response was 12.6 months.  
Data suggest that crizotinib, an oral TKI that inhibits multiple kinases, 
including ALK, ROS1, and MET, is also a viable option for patients with 
advanced NSCLC and METex14 skipping mutations.325  
NCCN Recommendations (NSCL-34) 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends capmatinib, tepotinib, or 
crizotinib as first-line treatment options for patients with advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC and METex14 skipping mutation. These are also 
recommended as subsequent therapy options, if the patient was not 
previously treated with capmatinib, tepotinib, or crizotinib. Capmatinib 
and tepotinib are categorized as preferred, while crizotinib is considered 
useful in certain circumstances. The panel notes that switching between 
agents with a similar mechanism of action at the time of progression is 
not recommended.  
Other systemic therapy regimens (such as chemotherapy with or without 
immunotherapy) listed on NSCL-K 1 of 5 and NSCL-K 2 of 5 in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC are recommended as useful in certain 
circumstances for first-line therapy. These are also recommended as 
subsequent therapy options in patients whose disease progressed 
following treatment with capmatinib, tepotinib, or crizotinib. Data indicate 
that ICI monotherapy may be less effective in NSCLC with MET 
alterations.184,1052 
NSCLC with RET Rearrangement 
RET rearrangements occur in about 1% to 2% of patients with NSCLC 
and are more frequent in patients with adenocarcinoma histology.332-336 
Rearrangements may occur between RET and other genes, including 
KIF5B and CCDC6, which can lead to overexpression and dysregulation 
of RET kinase and inappropriate signaling.332,333  
Clinical Data 
Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are oral TKIs that inhibit RET and are both 
approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC with RET 
gene fusion.1111-1113 
Libretto-001, a phase 1/2 study, assessed selpercatinib in patients with 
NSCLC and RET rearrangements.338,1114 Updated results from the trial 
showed that first-line therapy with selpercatinib yielded an objective 
response rate of 85%.338 Second-line therapy with selpercatinib yielded 
an objective response rate of 64%; the median PFS was 18.4 months. Of 
patients with brain metastases, a response to selpercatinib was reported 
in 91% (10/11). Common grade 3 or more AEs with selpercatinib 
included hypertension, increased liver enzyme levels, hyponatremia, and 
lymphopenia.  
Libretto-431, a randomized phase 3 trial, evaluated selpercatinib versus 
control (platinum-based chemotherapy with or without pembrolizumab) 
as first-line therapy in 212 patients with advanced NSCLC and RET gene 
fusion.1115 Based on the interim analysis, the median PFS was longer 
with selpercatinib than with the control treatment (24.8 months vs. 11.2 
months; HR, 0.46; P < .001). The HR for time to CNS progression was 
0.28. Among those with brain metastases at baseline, a higher 
proportion of patients in the selpercatinib group experienced an 
intracranial response compared with those in the control group (82% 
versus 58%).
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 216 ===
ARROW, a phase 1/2 study, assessed pralsetinib in 233 patients with 
metastatic NSCLC and RET rearrangements.337 First-line therapy with 
pralsetinib resulted in an overall response rate of 70%; 3 patients (11%) 
had a complete response. Second-line therapy with pralsetinib resulted 
in an overall response rate of 61% (53/87); 5 patients (6%) had a 
complete response. Among the nine patients with measurable brain 
metastases, a response to pralsetinib was reported in 56%; 3 patients 
had an intracranial complete response. Grade 3 or more AEs with 
pralsetinib include anemia, neutropenia, and hypertension. Common AEs 
with pralsetinib included increased AST levels, increased ALT levels, 
anemia, hypertension, constipation, and neutropenia. Updated data from 
the ARROW trial showed that the overall response rate with pralsetinib 
was 72% for those who were treatment-naïve and 59% for those who 
previously received platinum-based chemotherapy.1116 Among the 10 
patients with intracranial metastases (all who previously received 
systemic therapy), the intracranial response rate was 70%. 
Data suggest that cabozantinib, an oral kinase inhibitor active against 
multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including RET, MET, VEGFR2, and 
others,1111 is another viable treatment option for patients with RET-
positive metastatic NSCLC.339,340,1117 
NCCN Recommendations (NSCL-35) 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends selpercatinib or pralsetinib as 
preferred first-line therapy options for patients with advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC and RET rearrangements. Cabozantinib is 
recommended by the panel as a first-line therapy option that may be 
useful in certain circumstances. All are appropriate for performance 
status 0–4. These agents are also recommended as subsequent therapy 
options for patients with RET rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC 
if selpercatinib, pralsetinib, or cabozantinib were not previously given as 
first-line therapy. The panel notes that switching between agents with a 
similar mechanism of action at the time of progression is not 
recommended.  
Other systemic therapies (such as chemotherapy with or without 
immunotherapy) on NSCL-K 1 of 5 and NSCL-K 2 of 5 in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC are categorized as “other recommended” first-line 
treatment options for RET-positive advanced or metastatic NSCLC; 
these are also recommended as subsequent therapy options in patients 
whose disease progressed after treatment with selpercatinib, pralsetinib, 
or cabozantinib. Data indicate that ICI monotherapy may be less 
effective in NSCLC with RET rearrangements.184,1052 
NSCLC with ERBB2 (HER2) Mutation 
ERBB2 encodes for HER2, a receptor tyrosine kinase found on the 
surface of normal epithelial cells that is often overexpressed or mutated 
in a variety of human malignancies.1118 Approximately 3% of advanced 
NSCLC (adenocarcinoma) have a mutation in ERBB2 (HER2).169 
Resources are available to assess whether a specific ERBB2 (HER2) 
mutation is oncogenic or likely to be oncogenic (such as oncoKB.org).  
Clinical Data 
Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was granted accelerated approval by 
the FDA for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic 
NSCLC tumors that have activating ERBB2 (HER2) mutations, and who 
received a prior systemic therapy.1119 Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki 
is a humanized monoclonal antibody drug conjugate consisting of 
trastuzumab, an antibody targeting HER2, linked to deruxtecan, a 
topoisomerase I inhibitor; the agent remains stable until it is cleaved by 
peptides in cancer cells.169  
DESTINY-Lung01, a phase 2 study, assessed fam-trastuzumab 
deruxtecan-nxki in 91 patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC and 
ERBB2 mutations (not ERBB2 amplification). Most patients had
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 217 ===
ERBB2 (HER2) exon 20 insertion mutations (86%); 66% were female, 
57% had never smoked cigarettes, 36% had CNS metastases at 
baseline, and all had nonsquamous NSCLC.169 The objective response 
rate with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 55%; most patients had 
received prior treatment.169 Median OS was 17.8 months.169 Grade 3 or 
higher AEs occurred in 46% of patients including neutropenia (19%). 
Two patients died from drug-related interstitial lung disease.  
Data have shown that ado-trastuzumab emtansine (also known as 
T-DM1), a humanized antibody-drug conjugate consisting of trastuzumab 
and microtubule inhibitor emtansine, also has efficacy in patients with 
metastatic or recurrent NSCLC and ERBB2 (HER2) mutations.168,1122  

NCCN Recommendations (NSCL-36) 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends the systemic therapy regimens 
(such as chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy) listed on NSCL-
K 1 of 5 or NSCL-K 2 of 5 in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC for the 
first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC with ERBB2 
(HER2) mutations. Data indicate that ICI monotherapy may be less 
effective in NSCLC with ERBB2 (HER2) mutations.184,1052 
After disease progression, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is 
recommended as a preferred subsequent therapy option, while 
ado-trastuzumab emtansine is categorized as an “other recommended” 
option. The panel notes that switching between agents with a similar 
mechanism of action at the time of progression is not recommended.

Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC: Other 
Options and Additional Information 
For patients with metastatic NSCLC and contraindications to 
pembrolizumab or other ICIs, chemotherapy options are recommended 
(such as carboplatin plus paclitaxel), although some regimens may be 
more appropriate for certain patients, depending on histology, PS, and 
other factors (see Trial Data in this Discussion, and Systemic Therapy for 
Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC, the 
NCCN Compendium® for NSCLC, and the NCCN Guidelines with 
Evidence Blocks™ for NSCLC).962,1123 Chemotherapy with or without 
bevacizumab is an option if eligibility criteria are met for patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC and negative test results for actionable driver 
mutations, and with PD-L1 expression less than 1%.1124 Chemotherapy 
with or without bevacizumab regimens may be used as first-line or 
subsequent therapy options in eligible patients with actionable driver 
mutations as shown in the algorithm, although they are generally not 
preferred options. Targeted therapy is a preferred first-line therapy option 
for patients with actionable driver mutations, except for EGFR exon 20 
mutations or KRAS mutations. Previously, patients with brain metastases 
were excluded from receiving bevacizumab because of concerns about 
CNS hemorrhage; however, data suggest that bevacizumab can be used 
in patients with treated CNS metastases.1125 A phase 3 randomized trial in 
older patients (70–89 years) with advanced NSCLC reported that 
combined therapy with weekly paclitaxel and monthly carboplatin 
improved survival when compared with single-agent therapy using either 
gemcitabine or vinorelbine (10.3 vs. 6.2 months).1126 Systemic therapy for 
older patients with advanced NSCLC needs to be carefully selected to 
avoid adverse reactions.1127 The NCCN NSCLC Panel does not 
recommend carboplatin plus vinorelbine, cisplatin plus vinorelbine, 
etoposide, irinotecan, and vinorelbine for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC NOS and negative test results for 
actionable driver mutations, because these regimens are rarely used in 
the United States.  
For patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC and negative test 
results for actionable driver mutations, chemotherapy plus 
immunotherapy regimens—such as pembrolizumab plus carboplatin with 
either paclitaxel or albumin-bound paclitaxel—are recommended options 
(category 1; preferred). For patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC 
who have contraindications to ICIs, recommended options include cisplatin 
plus gemcitabine (category 1).790 Carboplatin plus paclitaxel, carboplatin 
plus gemcitabine (category 1 for both), and other regimens listed in the 
NSCLC algorithm are also recommended options (see Systemic Therapy 
for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC, 
the NCCN Compendium® for NSCLC, and the NCCN Guidelines with 
Evidence Blocks™ for NSCLC). Data supporting the combination 
platinum-based chemotherapy options are described in the following 
sections (see Clinical Trial Data in this Discussion). These chemotherapy 
with or without immunotherapy regimens may be used as first-line or 
subsequent therapy options in eligible patients with actionable driver 
mutations as shown in the algorithm, although they are generally not 
preferred options. Targeted therapy is a preferred first-line therapy option 
for patients with actionable driver mutations, except for EGFR exon 20 
mutations or KRAS mutations. The NCCN NSCLC Panel does not 
recommend carboplatin plus etoposide, carboplatin plus vinorelbine, 
cisplatin plus vinorelbine, cisplatin plus gemcitabine plus necitumumab, 
etoposide, irinotecan, and vinorelbine for patients with metastatic 
squamous cell NSCLC and negative test results for actionable driver 
mutations, because these regimens are rarely used in the United States 
although they may be used in other countries. Regimens containing 
pemetrexed or bevacizumab are not recommended for squamous cell 
carcinoma. Currently, fewer treatment options are available for patients 
with squamous cell carcinoma compared with nonsquamous NSCLC.

=== PAGE 219 ===
Clinical Trial Data 
Data show that platinum-based combination therapy is superior to best 
supportive care for patients with advanced, incurable disease who are not 
eligible for targeted therapy or immunotherapy. Cisplatin or carboplatin 
have been proven effective in combination with many of the following 
agents: docetaxel, etoposide, gemcitabine, paclitaxel (and albumin-bound 
paclitaxel), and pemetrexed (see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or 
Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).738,743,788-
790,797,798,818 Carboplatin-based regimens are often used for patients with 
comorbidities or those who cannot tolerate cisplatin.1128 Non-platinum 
regimens (eg, gemcitabine plus docetaxel, gemcitabine plus vinorelbine) 
are reasonable alternatives, because data show they are active and less 
toxic than platinum-based regimens.800-803,1129  
ECOG 4599, a phase 2/3 trial, randomly assigned 878 patients to either 1) 
bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel plus carboplatin; or 2) 
paclitaxel plus carboplatin alone.806,1130 Both regimens were well tolerated 
with selected toxicities. Patients receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel 
plus carboplatin showed an improved median survival (12.3 vs. 10.3 
months, P = .003) when compared to patients receiving paclitaxel plus 
carboplatin alone.806 The overall 1-year survival was 51% versus 44%; 
2-year survival was 23% versus 15%, respectively, in favor of the 
bevacizumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin arm.806 More significant 
toxicities were observed with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin 
compared to paclitaxel plus carboplatin (grade 4 neutropenia: 25.5% vs. 
16.8%; grade 5 hemoptysis: 1.2% vs. 0%; and grade 3 hypertension: 6.8% 
vs. 0.5%). Treatment-related deaths were more common with 
bevacizumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin (15 patients) than with 
paclitaxel plus carboplatin (2 patients) (P = .001). An analysis of ECOG 
4599 found that patients with adenocarcinoma histology receiving 
bevacizumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin had improved survival 
compared with chemotherapy alone (14.2 vs. 10.3 months).1124 AVAiL, a 
phase 3 randomized trial, compared cisplatin plus gemcitabine with (or 
without) bevacizumab; survival was not increased with the addition of 
bevacizumab.1131,1132 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends that 
bevacizumab biosimilars may be used in any of the systemic therapy 
regimens containing bevacizumab (eg, carboplatin plus paclitaxel plus 
bevacizumab) that are used for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC 
based on clinical data and FDA approvals.833,846-849  
A noninferiority trial in 1725 patients with advanced NSCLC (either stage 
IIIB or IV; most were stage IV) assessed cisplatin plus gemcitabine 
compared with cisplatin plus pemetrexed.790 Patients with either 
adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma (ie, nonsquamous NSCLC) had 
improved survival with cisplatin plus pemetrexed (adenocarcinoma: 12.6 
vs. 10.9 months). Patients with squamous cell carcinoma had improved 
survival with the cisplatin plus gemcitabine regimen (10.8 vs. 9.4 months). 
When compared with the cisplatin plus gemcitabine regimen, the cisplatin 
plus pemetrexed regimen had significantly lower rates of grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia (P ≤ .001); febrile 
neutropenia (P = .002); and alopecia (P < .001). Treatment-related deaths 
were similar for both regimens (cisplatin plus pemetrexed, 9 patients 
[1.0%]; cisplatin plus gemcitabine, 6 patients [0.7%]). An analysis of three 
phase 3 trials confirmed that pemetrexed improves survival for patients 
with nonsquamous NSCLC in first-line, subsequent, and maintenance 
therapy.1133  
Number of Cycles of First-Line Systemic Therapy  
Data from the PARAMOUNT trial suggest that 4 cycles of platinum-based 
therapy is not optimal;881 tumors can shrink between 4 to 6 cycles of 
chemotherapy. However, patients may not be able to tolerate more than 4 
cycles of chemotherapy, and most of the maintenance trials used only 4 
cycles of chemotherapy.810 A meta-analysis suggests that continuing the 
initial regimen beyond 4 to 6 cycles is associated with increased PFS;
=== END PAGE ===


=== PAGE 220 ===
however, patients have more adverse events.1134 A phase 3 randomized 
trial suggested that continuing chemotherapy beyond 4 to 6 cycles is not 
beneficial; however, many patients assigned to a longer duration of 
therapy did not receive the planned number of cycles.807,808 In this phase 3 
trial, taxane-based regimens were used and patients had increasing 
neurotoxicity as more cycles were used.807  
Many patients with adenocarcinoma receive pemetrexed-based regimens 
and not taxane-based regimens. Pemetrexed-based regimens are less 
toxic than taxane-based regimens. Thus, data suggesting that more than 6 
cycles of first-line chemotherapy are not appropriate may only apply to 
taxane-based regimens.810 Studies report that 60% of patients were able 
to receive 6 cycles of pemetrexed-based chemotherapy (and had a low 
incidence of toxicity), whereas only 42% were able to receive more than 5 
cycles of taxane-based chemotherapy and often stopped therapy because 
of neurotoxicity.807,883  
The NCCN Guidelines recommend that patients receiving first-line 
systemic therapy for advanced disease should be evaluated for tumor 
response with a CT scan. Response assessment should occur after 2 
cycles of initial therapy and then every 2 to 4 cycles using CT of known 
or high-risk sites of disease (with or without contrast) or when clinically 
indicated.263,1135-1137 Patients with responsive or stable disease can 
continue to receive a total of 4 to 6 cycles of systemic therapy.714,807,1138 
The NCCN Guidelines do not recommend continuing chemotherapy 
beyond 4 to 6 cycles. Generally, patients with metastatic NSCLC receive 
4 cycles of initial systemic chemotherapy (eg, carboplatin plus 
pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab for nonsquamous NSCLC) before 
starting maintenance therapy. However, if patients are tolerating the 
therapy, then 6 cycles of systemic therapy can be considered. 
Approximately 25% of patients show disease progression after the initial 
cycle of chemotherapy; subsequent therapy is recommended for these 
patients (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
Maintenance Therapy  
Maintenance therapy is an option for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC, with responsive or stable disease after first-line 
systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy 
(see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
A phase 3 randomized trial in 663 patients with advanced NSCLC 
assessed the effect of best supportive care with (or without) switch 
maintenance pemetrexed in patients who had received platinum-based 
chemotherapy but whose tumors had not progressed.891 Overall survival 
was 13.4 months (95% CI, 11.9–15.9) with pemetrexed compared with 
10.6 months (95% CI, 8.7–12.0) with placebo (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.42–
0.61; P < .0001).  
IUNO, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed erlotinib as switch 
maintenance therapy (and as subsequent therapy) for patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC and PS 0 to 2 but without EGFR mutations.893 
Overall survival and PFS were not improved in patients receiving erlotinib 
when compared with placebo. The NCCN NSCLC Panel does not 
recommend erlotinib as switch maintenance therapy (and as subsequent 
therapy) for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC and PS 0 to 2 but without 
EGFR mutations based on clinical trial data and a revised indication by the 
FDA.893  
For patients with squamous cell NSCLC, pembrolizumab was used as 
continuation maintenance therapy if patients received either 
pembrolizumab plus carboplatin plus either paclitaxel or albumin-bound 
paclitaxel or they received pembrolizumab alone (see Immune 
Checkpoint Inhibitors in this Discussion). IFCT-GFPC 0502, a phase 3 
randomized trial, compared maintenance therapy with either gemcitabine

or erlotinib after initial cytotoxic therapy with cisplatin plus gemcitabine in 
patients with advanced NSCLC.742,887 Continuation maintenance therapy 
with single-agent gemcitabine increased PFS to a greater extent (3.8 
months) than switch maintenance therapy with erlotinib (2.9 months) 
compared with observation (1.9 months).742,887 A phase 3 trial assessed 
switch maintenance therapy with docetaxel given either immediately after 
chemotherapy or delayed until progression in patients with advanced 
NSCLC.895 Many patients in the delayed chemotherapy arm did not 
receive docetaxel.896  
Depending on first-line therapy, the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
continuation maintenance therapy options for patients with nonsquamous 
NSCLC with atezolizumab, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (category 1), 
bevacizumab (category 1), bevacizumab plus pemetrexed, 
cemiplimab-rwlc with or without pemetrexed (category 1), durvalumab with 
or without pemetrexed (category 1), gemcitabine (category 2B), nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab, pembrolizumab (category 1), pembrolizumab plus 
pemetrexed (category 1), or pemetrexed (category 1) (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).742,806,812,881,885,887,1139 Switch maintenance therapy 
with pemetrexed is a recommended option for patients with nonsquamous 
NSCLC.742,887,890,891 The benefits of continuation maintenance therapy with 
gemcitabine were very slight; therefore, the recommendation is only 
category 2B.742 For patients with squamous cell NSCLC and depending on 
first-line therapy, the panel recommends continuation maintenance 
therapy with atezolizumab, cemiplimab-rwlc (category 1), durvalumab, 
gemcitabine (category 2B), nivolumab plus ipilimumab, or pembrolizumab. 
Previously, the NCCN Panel deleted the recommendation for docetaxel 
(category 2B) as switch maintenance therapy for patients with squamous 
cell NSCLC because there are better options.896  
 
Second-Line and Beyond (Subsequent) Systemic Therapy 
The phrase subsequent therapy is substituted for the terms second-line, 
third-line, and beyond systemic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines, because 
the line of therapy may vary depending on previous treatment with 
targeted agents. Subsequent systemic therapy options for patients with 
disease progression during or after first-line therapy are described in the 
NSCLC algorithm and depend on the specific genetic variant, the 
histologic subtype, whether the patient has symptoms, and PS (see the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).1140-1149 The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends response assessment of known or high-risk sites of disease 
with CT with or without contrast every 6 to 12 weeks in patients receiving 
subsequent therapy or maintenance therapy. Note that traditional RECIST 
response criteria (1.1) are used to assess response for most types of 
systemic therapy, but different response criteria may be useful for 
assessing response in patients receiving PD-1 or PD-L1 
inhibitors.263,1135,1137,1150-1152 If patients have received and completed 
first-line systemic therapy (such as carboplatin plus paclitaxel), including 
maintenance therapy, before receiving targeted therapy for an actionable 
mutation, but have disease progression on targeted therapy, then certain 
subsequent therapy options are recommended, such as docetaxel.  
If patients have not previously received an ICI, the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends (category 1) atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab as 
preferred subsequent therapy options in eligible patients with metastatic 
NSCLC based on clinical trial data and FDA approvals (see Immune 
Checkpoint Inhibitors in this Discussion).358,362,834,835,851,858 Human ICI 
antibodies inhibit the PD-1 receptor or PD-L1, which improves antitumor 
immunity; PD-1 receptors are expressed on activated cytotoxic T cells.358-
360  
Most patients with NSCLC do not have actionable driver mutations [eg, 
ALK, BRAF p.V600E, EGFR, ERBB2 (HER2), KRAS, METex14 skipping,

NTRK1/2/3, RET, ROS1]. Platinum-based doublet therapy is 
recommended (eg, carboplatin plus paclitaxel) as subsequent systemic 
therapy options for patients with metastatic NSCLC (but without these 
genetic variants), positive PD-L1 levels (≥50%), and disease progression 
after first-line therapy with single-agent ICIs. For patients with metastatic 
NSCLC and disease progression after first-line therapy with ICIs plus 
chemotherapy, subsequent systemic therapy options include docetaxel 
(± ramucirumab), gemcitabine, albumin-bound paclitaxel, or pemetrexed 
(for nonsquamous only), depending on which agent was not previously 
given. For patients with all histologic subtypes and PS of 0 to 2, but 
without these genetic variants, who have disease progression during or 
after first-line platinum-based combination therapy, recommended 
subsequent systemic therapy options include single-agent ICIs or 
chemotherapy. If ICIs have not previously been given, the panel 
recommends (category 1) atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab as 
preferred subsequent therapy options for all histologic subtypes based on 
improved survival rates, longer duration of response, and fewer adverse 
events when compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy (see Immune 
Checkpoint Inhibitors in this Discussion).358,362,834,835,851,858  
Data show that overall survival is improved with subsequent therapy with 
atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab compared with 
docetaxel.834,835,858 However, some patients cannot tolerate 
immunotherapy or have had disease progression on immunotherapy. A 
phase 3 randomized trial assessed ramucirumab plus docetaxel versus 
docetaxel as subsequent therapy options for all histologic subtypes.1153 
Docetaxel has been proven superior to best supportive care, vinorelbine, 
or ifosfamide with improved survival and quality of life.1146,1147 When 
compared with docetaxel, pemetrexed has similar median survival but less 
toxicity.1148,1154 Pemetrexed is a recommended subsequent therapy option 
for eligible patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC.891 Docetaxel is 
recommended for patients with wild-type EGFR tumors based on two 
randomized trials comparing erlotinib versus docetaxel.1155,1156 Patients 
often have a limited response to subsequent therapy other than ICIs, 
although chemotherapy may serve a useful palliative role.1157  
ABOUND, a phase 2 trial, assessed albumin-bound paclitaxel with or 
without oral 5-azacitidine as subsequent therapy in 161 patients with 
advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.1158 Median overall survival was 8.1 
months with combination therapy and 17 months with single-agent 
albumin-bound paclitaxel (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.08–2.57). Grade 3 or 
greater adverse events were reported in 41% of patients receiving 
combination therapy and 32% of single-agent albumin-bound paclitaxel.  
The NSCLC Panel recommends the following subsequent therapy options 
for patients with metastatic NSCLC, depending on which agents have not 
previously been given: 1) atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab if 
none has been previously given (all are category 1, preferred); 2) 
docetaxel (± ramucirumab); 3) gemcitabine; 4) albumin-bound paclitaxel; 
or 5) pemetrexed (nonsquamous only). In patients with PS of 3 to 4, best 
supportive care is recommended (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).664,721,722 After second disease progression, subsequent therapy is 
recommended for certain patients if the following agents have not already 
been given: 1) atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab if none has 
been previously given; 2) docetaxel (± ramucirumab; category 2B for 
both); 3) gemcitabine (category 2B); 4) albumin-bound paclitaxel (category 
2B); or 5) pemetrexed (nonsquamous only) (category 2B).1141,1156,1159,1160 
These patients include those with advanced NSCLC and a PS of 0 to 2. 
UNO, a randomized trial, showed that overall survival and PFS were not 
improved in patients receiving erlotinib as a subsequent therapy option 
when compared with placebo.893 The NCCN NSCLC Panel does not 
recommend erlotinib as a subsequent therapy option (or as switch 
maintenance therapy) for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC and PS of 0 
to 2 but without EGFR mutations based on clinical trial data and a revised

indication by the FDA.893 A phase 3 randomized trial compared afatinib 
with erlotinib as subsequent therapy options for patients with squamous 
cell NSCLC .1161 Overall survival was 7.9 months (95% CI, 7.2–8.7) for 
afatinib versus 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.9–7.8) for erlotinib (HR, 0.81; 95% 
CI, 0.69–0.95; P = .0077). Almost 60% of patients in each arm had grade 
3 or higher adverse events. In contrast, the median overall survival was 
9.2 months with nivolumab compared with 6.0 months for docetaxel for 
patients with squamous cell NSCLC.362 In addition, only 7% of patients 
receiving nivolumab had grade 3 or higher adverse events. The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel does not recommend erlotinib as a subsequent therapy 
option for patients with squamous cell NSCLC based on this study 
comparing afatinib with erlotinib; this study was statistically significant but 
not clinically significant.1161 Erlotinib or afatinib are not recommended as 
subsequent therapy options for patients with squamous cell NSCLC; they 
are less efficacious and safe compared to other available options.1161  
Summary  
Management of NSCLC is described in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC, 
which include the algorithm and this supporting Discussion text. Revisions 
for the 2023 update of the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC are described in 
this Discussion and outlined in the algorithm (see Summary of the 
Guidelines Updates in the algorithm). Most lung cancer (approximately 
85%) is due to NSCLC; SCLC accounts for about 15% of lung cancer. 
Recommendations for SCLC are provided in a different guideline (see the 
NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer, available at 
www.NCCN.org). The NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC are updated at least 
once a year by the NCCN NSCLC Panel; there were 6 updates to the 
2022 guidelines.  
For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel revised the 
Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis. For example, the NCCN 
Panel added testing recommendations for ERBB2 (HER2) mutations. 
NGS-based approaches are best able to detect the broad spectrum of 
genomic ERBB2 (HER2) alterations that may occur, although Sanger 
sequencing and targeted PCR approaches may also be used. The NCCN 
Panel also revised the Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC. For example, the NCCN Panel clarified that a 
preoperative biopsy may be useful for patients with early-stage NSCLC 
(ie, clinical stage IB or more) who may be candidates for systemic therapy 
before surgery (also known as neoadjuvant, induction, or preoperative 
therapy).107 The NCCN Panel added a recommendation that patients 
should be evaluated for perioperative (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) therapy 
before surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy should not be used to attempt to 
induce resectability in patients who do not already meet criteria for 
resectability on initial evaluation. 
For the 2023 update (Version 2), the NCCN Panel added a 
recommendation for adjuvant pembrolizumab for eligible patients with 
completely resected (R0) stage IIB to IIIA, stage IIIB (only T3,N2), or 
high-risk stage IIA NSCLC who are negative for EGFR exon 19 deletions, 
EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, or ALK fusions and who have previously 
received adjuvant chemotherapy.751 The panel added a caveat that the 
benefit of adjuvant pembrolizumab is unclear for patients with PD-L1 
levels less than 1%. The NCCN Panel also expanded the molecular 
testing criteria to include ALK rearrangements because patients with 
completely resected (R0) NSCLC who have ALK rearrangements, EGFR 
exon 19 deletions, or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations have less benefit 
from ICIs.184 Single-agent therapy with osimertinib is recommended for 
eligible patients with completely resected (R0) stage IB–IIIA or stage IIIB 
(T3, N2) NSCLC if patients have EGFR exon 19 deletions or EGFR exon 
21 L858R mutations, regardless of PD-L1 levels. The NCCN Panel 
clarified that adjuvant chemotherapy followed by single-agent therapy with 
osimertinib is recommended for eligible patients with completely resected 
(R0) early-stage NSCLC if patients have both EGFR mutations and PD-L1

levels of 1% or more; the panel does not recommend using atezolizumab 
or pembrolizumab, or combined therapy with osimertinib and either 
atezolizumab or pembrolizumab in this setting.  
For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel expanded the 
criteria for using adjuvant osimertinib, atezolizumab, or pembrolizumab for 
eligible patients with completely resected (R0) early-stage NSCLC to 
include certain patients with stage IIIB (only T3,N2) disease based on 
differences between the AJCC staging systems for the 7th and 8th 
editions.159 Although the 8th edition of the AJCC staging manual is 
currently being used, the clinical trials used the 7th edition.  
For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
adagrasib as a subsequent therapy option for select patients with 
metastatic NSCLC and KRAS p.G12C mutations who have disease 
progression after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (± 
immunotherapy) based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.315 
Responsiveness to adagrasib has not been assessed for mutations other 
than KRAS p.G12C. The NCCN Panel clarified that adagrasib is 
recommended as third-line or beyond therapy if the patient has not 
previously received targeted therapy for KRAS p.G12C mutations. The 
NCCN Panel also recommends lorlatinib as a subsequent therapy option, 
if not previously given, for patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC 
and symptomatic brain metastases.1162,1163  
For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel clarified that 
postoperative RT may be considered for select patients with high-risk N2 
disease such as extracapsular extension, multistation involvement, 
inadequate lymph node dissection or sampling, and/or refusal or 
intolerance of adjuvant systemic therapy.450,453,767 The Panel revised the 
algorithm for multiple lung cancers. For example, the NCCN Panel added 
an initial recommendation for multidisciplinary evaluation for patients 
suspected of or confirmed with having multiple lung cancers. One of the
goals during multidisciplinary evaluation for multiple lung cancers is to 
assess whether patients have lung nodules that can be observed instead 
of erroneously assuming that patients have stage IV NSCLC. The panel 
also added the following caveats: lesions at low risk of becoming 
symptomatic can be observed, such as small subsolid nodules with slow 
growth. However, treatment should be considered if the lesion(s) show 
accelerating growth, increasing solid component, or increasing FDG 
uptake, even if the lesions are small.
